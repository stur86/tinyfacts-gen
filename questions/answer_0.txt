To be able means you have the power to do a thing. If you are able to walk, your legs work and you can go where you want. If you are able to read, your eyes see the words and your brain knows what they mean.

Some things are able from the beginning. A tiny animal in the blue water is already able to move and live there. Other things become able after they learn. You were not able to talk when you were very young. Then you listened and tried. Now you are able to speak to your friends and family.

We can also be able because of things we build. You are not able to fly with your arms. But with a big thing built for the sky, you are able to go to far cities very fast.

Sometimes, we think we are not able because we are afraid. But if we try and do not stop, we find that we can. Being able is a great thing. It means you can act and change your world.
