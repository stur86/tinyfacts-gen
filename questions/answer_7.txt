"After" is a word we use to talk about time and where things are. It means that something comes later than another thing. 

Think about your day. First, you wake up. After you wake up, you might eat breakfast. You can not eat breakfast while you are still asleep! One thing has to happen first, and the other thing comes after. 

We see this order in how people grow. Everyone is a tiny baby at the start. After some years pass, the baby becomes a child. After more years, the child becomes a man or a woman. You can never be old first and young second. The older years always come after the younger years. 

"After" also tells us about where things are. Imagine you are walking in a line with your friends to go into a room. If your friend is in front of you, you are after your friend. If you are at the end of the line, you are after everyone else. 

In a world with no "after," everything would happen at the same time. That would be very confusing! There would be no beginning and no end. We need "after" so we can understand our lives, tell stories, and know when it is time for dinner.
