To act is to pretend you are a person you are not. You might act like a doctor, a teacher, or even a dog. People act in movies or in front of many people on a high floor in a big room. 

When you act, you change how you look and how you talk. You wear different clothes. You learn words and say them as if they are your own ideas. You use your face and your body to show how the person feels. If the person is angry, you might yell and make your face look hard. If the person is sad, you might cry. 

Sometimes acting is hard because you have to feel things that are not happening in real life. But it is a way to tell stories that help people understand each other. It allows us to see the world through the eyes of another person without leaving our seats.
