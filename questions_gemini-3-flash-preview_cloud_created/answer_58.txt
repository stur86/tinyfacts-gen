Your back is the part of your body that is behind you. It starts at your neck and goes down to where you sit. It is a very important part because it helps you stand up straight.

Inside your back, there is a long line of hard parts. These hard parts go from your head down to your bottom. They keep you from falling over. There are also other hard parts that go around to your front. They guard the parts of you that breathe and the part that beats inside your chest.

Your back has many strong parts that help you move. You use your back when you walk, run, or jump. You also use it when you lift heavy things. Sometimes, if you lift something too heavy, your back might hurt.

The skin on your back is hard to see by yourself. You might need a mirror to see it. Sometimes that area feels funny, but your arms are not long enough to reach the spot. Then you have to ask a friend to help you or rub your back against a wall like an animal.
