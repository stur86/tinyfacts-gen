To bother someone is to do things that make them feel a bit angry or annoyed. This often happens even if you do not mean to cause trouble. You might do it by making noise when they are trying to sleep. Or you might do it by asking too many questions when they are busy with their work.

When you bother a person, you take away their calm feeling. They want to focus on what they are doing, but you are in the way. They might frown or sigh to show they are not happy. If you keep doing it, they might eventually yell.

Animals can also be bothered. Imagine a small fly that flies around the head of a dog. The fly lands on the nose of the dog over and over again. The dog gets annoyed and tries to snap at the fly. The dog just wants the fly to go away so it can relax.

Sometimes we even talk about bothering things that do not live. A child might be told not to bother the food on the table before dinner. This means the child should not touch it or change it. But usually, when we say stop bothering that, we really mean that the person is making someone else angry.

It is good to notice when you are bothering others. If a friend stops talking or looks at their phone, they might want to be alone. If you see this, you can decide to stop. Being quiet and giving them space is a way to show you care.
