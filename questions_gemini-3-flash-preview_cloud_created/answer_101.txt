A bore is a thing that makes a deep opening in something hard. It turns around and around very fast. As it turns, it pushes into the thing it is touching. This makes a round empty space in the middle of a hard thing.

Some of these are small. You can hold them in your hand. You use them to build chairs or tables. They go through wood or other hard parts of a house. They help you put things together.

Some are very large. They are bigger than a house. These huge ones can bore into the ground. They cut through rocks and bits of the ground. They make long hallways under the ground. These hallways are for trains to move people through the city. They can also go under the water.

When people want to find water deep in the ground, they use a bore. It goes down far where no one can see. It brings up facts about what is under us. Sometimes it finds old things from long ago. Sometimes it finds dark wet stuff that gives us power for our cars.

It is a very important thing. Without it, we could not build tall places to live or go easily under cities.
