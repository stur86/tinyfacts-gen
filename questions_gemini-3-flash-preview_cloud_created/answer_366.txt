A first is the start of something new. It is the thing that happens before any others. When you do something for the first time, it is a first. 

When you were a small baby, you had many firsts. You had the first time you opened your eyes. You had the first time you drank from a bottle. You had the first time you saw your mom and dad. 

A first can make you feel afraid. The first day of school is a big first. You see many new children. You enter a new building. You do not know the way, but you learn. 

Some firsts are known by everyone. A long time ago, a man went far up into the dark sky. He was the first to walk on the cold, round rock that is bright at night. He left his mark in the ground. The whole world watched him do it. 

Your life is full of firsts. Each one changes you a little bit. You will always remember the most important ones. You remember your first friend, your first car, or the first time you felt love. These moments stay with you as memories in your brain for a long time.
