"Away" is a word used to talk about things that are not here. It usually tells us about where things are or where they are going. It has many uses.

Most of the time, this word means "not in this place." If you leave your home to go to a far city, you are going away. If you don't want to see someone, you might tell them to "Go away!" This means they should leave the area where you are.

We also use it to talk about how far things are. If your school is a ten minute walk from your house, it is ten minutes away. It tells us about the space between two places.

When people play games on a team, they have home games and away games. An away game is when the team goes to another city to play. They do not have their own friends to watch them or their own field to play on.

The word can also mean that something is being put into the right place. After you wear your clothes, you might put them away in a tall box made of wood with doors. This means you are moving them to the place where they stay so the room looks clean.

Sometimes, we use it to talk about time. If something will happen in three days, it is three days away. Or if something happened a long time ago, we might say it happened "far away in the past."

One more way we use it is to say that something is slowly ending. If a fire starts to go out, it might burn away. If a sound becomes so quiet that you can't hear it, it has died away.
