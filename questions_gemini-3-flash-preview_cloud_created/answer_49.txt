An attack is when one person or thing tries to hurt another. This often happens because someone wants to take something that is not their own. It can be a fight between two people. They might use their arms or legs to hit.

Sometimes animals attack if they are afraid or if they want to eat. They might use their teeth or feet to beat the other animal. A loud noise or a sudden move might cause them to act this way.

Today, attacks can also happen on computers. A person far away might try to get inside your computer. They want to take your name, your money, or things you want to keep hidden. They send bad bits to break the locks on your computer.

The body can also have an attack. A heart attack happens when blood can not get to where it needs to go. This makes the person very sick, and they must see a doctor quickly.

People often build walls or have guards to stay safe. If you know an attack is coming, you can get ready. You can hide or you can fight back. Staying safe is very important for families and for the places where people live.
