Air is the stuff around us. We can not see it, but it is always there. It is made of many things you can not see. Most of it is one type of thing, but a small part is something we must breathe to live. Animals need this to live.

Even though you can not see air, it is real and it takes up space. When you put air into a bag, the air makes the bag big. When the air moves fast, we call it wind. The wind can move trees and things that move on the water.

Air also keeps our world warm. It is like a cover around the world. It stops too much of the hot from leaving. Without air, the world would be very cold.

Green things that grow use air too. They take in one part of the air and give out the part we need to breathe. This is why green growing things are very important for us and for the world.

High up in the sky, there is less air. This makes it harder to breathe if you climb a very high place. Also, air is why the sky looks blue during the day. When light from the sun hits the air, the blue color is what we see.

Sometimes air can be not clean. This happens if we burn too many things. We need to keep the air clean so we can stay well.
