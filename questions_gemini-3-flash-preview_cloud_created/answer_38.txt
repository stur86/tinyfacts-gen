An approach is when you move closer to something. When you walk toward a house, you are making an approach.

Things that fly do this too. When a thing that flies is ready to touch the ground, it starts its approach. It must move carefully so that everyone is safe. If the approach is not good, the thing that flies might have to try again.

You can also have an approach to a problem. This is the way you decide to do something. If you have a lot of work, you might decide to do the hard parts first. That is your approach. Someone else might decide to do the easy parts first. That is a different approach.

Using different approaches can help you find the best way to finish a job. It is good to think before you start so you know which approach to take.
