To bed something or someone can mean many different things.

One way is about love. If a person beds someone, it means they go to bed together. They do this because they like each other. You might hear this in old stories.

Another way is about children. A mother or father can bed a child. This means they help the child get ready for sleep. They put the child in their bed and pull the covers up.

You can also bed small things that grow. You take a small green thing and put it into the ground. You do this so it stays in one place. This helps it grow to be big and strong.

A road can also have a bed. This is the hard ground under the part where cars go. It is there to keep the road strong so it does not break.

Finally, you can bed a hard thing into a place. You push a heavy part of a building into something soft that will become hard like a wall. This makes sure the building stays still and does not fall over.
