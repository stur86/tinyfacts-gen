When people say you "body" someone, it means you beat them in a serious way. It is a way to say you were much better than the other person in a game or a fight. It means they had no chance because you were so strong or fast. They lost and you were the best.

The word often comes from people who speak fast to music. If two of these people have a fight with words and one person is much better, we say that person "bodies" the other.

You can use this for other games too. In a game with a ball, if you have many points and the other person has none, you "body" them. It also means you did something so well that it was like the other person was not even there. It is a word used to show you are the best. It means you finished as the top person in a way that was complete. Everyone who saw it knows you are the one who did the best work.
