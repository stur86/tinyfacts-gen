Feeling angry is a big thing that happens to our bodies and brains. When a person is angry, their face can turn red or they might look like they want to scare you. Their heart beats fast and they might have a loud voice.

Thinking about why someone feels this way is important. They might feel that something is not right or that another person did something bad because they wanted to. Maybe you broke their favorite thing or said words that hurt. When you do these things, you are making them angry.

Sometimes, animals can get angry too. If you go near their babies or take their food, they might try to bite or attack. It is their way of saying "stop".

It is not good to stay angry for a long time. It can make your head and stomach hurt. Most people try to breathe and stay quiet until they feel better. Being kind and talking in a nice way can help stop the anger.
