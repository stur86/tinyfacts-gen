This word helps us talk about time and things that happened. We use it to tell people that something is done.

One way to use the word is when we finished a job earlier than we thought. If a man starts to build a house in the morning and finishes it by lunch, you might say "He is already done!" This shows you are surprised because he was so fast.

We also use this word to tell people we do not need to do something now. If your mother asks you to clean your room, but you finished it an hour ago, you say you "already" cleaned it. You did the work before she asked you. This means the work is over.

Sometimes the word shows that a situation has changed. If you look outside and see that the sun is gone, you can say "It is already night." This means the day ended sooner than you felt it would.

This word helps when you want to show that something is true before another person expects it to be.
