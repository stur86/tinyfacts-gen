To finger something means you use the long parts of your hand to touch it. These parts are your fingers. You can feel if a thing is soft or hard. You might move your fingers over a book or a piece of wood.

Sometimes, the word means you point at a person. Imagine a bad thing happened. Someone took a bag of money. You saw who did it. You tell the police, "He is the one!" When you point him out to the police, people say you fingered him. It means you showed everyone who the bad person was.

People who make music also use this word. When they play a song, they must put their fingers in the right places. They might press down on the small lines of a music thing or the black and white keys of a large box that makes sound. How they decide to use their fingers to play the notes is called fingering.
