Felt is a kind of stuff used to make clothes or covers. It is very old. People have made it for many, many years.

Usually, when we make things to wear, we take long bits of animal hair and put them over and under each other. This is like making a group of lines that cross. But felt is different. It is not made by crossing lines.

To make it, we take lots of animal hair. We make the hair wet with hot water. Then we press it very hard. We rub it and push it together. The tiny bits of hair catch onto each other. When we push and rub them with hot water, they get stuck. Then they will not come away from each other.

This makes a thick, soft piece of stuff. It can be very strong. It can keep you warm.

People use felt for many things. They use it to make things to put on their heads. They use it inside shoes to keep feet warm. Sometimes, the green top of a table where people play games with balls is made of this stuff. Because felt does not have crossed lines, you can cut it and it will not come to pieces at the edges. It stays together well.
