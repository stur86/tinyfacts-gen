To attempt something means to try to do it. Imagine you want to climb a tall tree. You haven't done it before. You start to pull yourself up. Maybe you fall down. If you try to reach the top, you are making an attempt.

It matters most when the thing is hard or new. You may not know if you can do it. But you still want to see if it is possible. This is why you must try.

When you attempt to talk to a person, you are trying to get their attention. Maybe you want to be their friend or tell them something important. You might feel nervous because you don't know if they will like you. The first time you speak, that is your attempt.

If you try to be the best in a game or run very fast, you are attempting to beat others. Even if you do not finish first, you still tried. You made an attempt. It takes work and you must focus. Attempting something shows you are not afraid to try things that are not easy.
