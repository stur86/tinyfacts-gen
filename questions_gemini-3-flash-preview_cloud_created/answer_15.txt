To "air" can mean a few different things.

First, it is used when a show is on the TV or the music box. When the show is happening right now, people say it is "airing". This is how pictures and sounds go out so everyone can watch or listen.

Second, it is used when you talk about what you think. If you have a problem, you might "air" it. This means you tell others what you think and how you feel. You do not keep the things that bother you inside your head anymore.

Third, there is a way younger people use this word today. If someone sends you words on a phone, but you do not answer, you "air" them. You see what they wrote, but you act like you did not see it. You do not talk back to them. This can make the person feel sad or angry because you are ignoring them.

One more way is about a room. If a room smells bad, you might "air" it. You open the windows to let the old air go out and the new air come in. This makes the room feel better.
