To attack someone or something is to try to hurt them. It is to move against them in a way that is not nice. People and animals do this for many reasons.

Sometimes, an attack happens with the body. A person might use their hands to hit or their feet to kick. They might use a thing that cuts or a heavy thing to cause pain. They do this to be the one who is stronger or to take a thing that you own. Animals might attack if they are afraid. A dog might bite to stop you from coming near. A cat might use the bits on its feet that cut if it feels in trouble.

Attacks are not always done with bodies. People use words to attack, too. They say bad things to make another person feel small or sad. This does not hurt the body, but it hurts the mind and the heart.

There is also a type of attack that happens on computers. Someone might try to get into a computer that is not their own. They want to find facts or take money. They use many numbers and letters to break the locks inside the computer.

Most of the time, attacking is a bad thing to do. It causes people to worry and feel fear. It is often better to use words to talk through a problem than to try to hurt someone.
