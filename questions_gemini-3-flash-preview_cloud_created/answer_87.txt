When something is black, it takes in all the light that hits it. Most things have a color because they send some light back to your eyes. A red thing sends red light back. A blue thing sends blue light back. A white thing sends almost all the light back to you. But a black thing takes all the light and keeps it. It does not let any light go.

Because it keeps the light, a black thing can get very warm. If you wear black clothes on a day with lots of sun, you will feel hot. This happens because the light stays in the clothes and makes them warm.

The sky at night is black because the sun is far away and no light is hitting that part of the sky. Space is very, very black too. Sometimes things look black when they are in a shadow where no light can reach them. A deep place in the ground might look black because the light from the sun can't get to the bottom.

Nothing is totally black, but some things are very close. Some animals are black so that they can hide in the dark.
