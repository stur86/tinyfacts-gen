To avoid something means you try to stay away from it. If you do not want to see a person, you might walk a different way when you see them. If you see them coming down a hallway, you might go into a room or look at your phone. You do this so you do not have to talk to them or say hello.

We also avoid things that make us afraid. If there is a big dog that looks mean, we do not walk near it. We find a different road to go home. This keeps us safe from things that could hurt us.

Sometimes people avoid doing their work. This is when we do not do the things we need to do. We might watch a movie or play games instead of doing our school work. This can make life hard later because the work is still waiting for us.

We can also avoid hard conversations. We might not talk about a problem with a friend because it makes us feel nervous. We act like everything is fine. We hope the problem will go away on its own, but it usually stays until we face it.
