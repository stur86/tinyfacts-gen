Being angry is a very strong feeling. It often starts when someone is mean to you or when things do not happen the way they should. You might feel very hot inside your chest. Your heart will beat faster than usual. Your face might turn red, and your eyes look hard.

When you are angry, you may want to shout or throw things. Your voice might become very loud. You might say words that are not nice. This is because your brain is telling your body to be ready to fight.

Animals feel this too. An angry dog will show its teeth and make a low sound. A cat will make its hair stand up so it looks bigger.

Anger can be a good thing because it shows you that a situation is wrong. However, it can also cause trouble. If you act while you are angry, you might do something you will be sorry for later.

To help, you can take a slow breath. You can also walk away from the person that made you mad. After some time, the hot feeling will go away. Then you can think better and use your words to explain why you were mad.
