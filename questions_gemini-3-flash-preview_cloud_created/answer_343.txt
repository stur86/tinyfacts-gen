To have felt something means you used your body or your mind to know about the world around you. 

Our skin has tiny parts that tell our brain if things are cold or if they hurt. When you touch a dog with your hand, you might say you felt its soft hair. If you did this a few minutes ago, you use the word felt to talk about it.

You also have things you feel inside your heart and mind. If your mother gave you something nice, you might have felt happy. If you fell down and hurt your knee, you felt pain. Because it happened in the past, you say I felt it. 

To have felt someone can mean you touched them. A doctor might have felt your arm to see if the hard part inside was broken. It can also mean you understood how another person was acting. If a friend was crying, you might have felt sad for them. 

To have felt something is how we know what is happening to us and how we share the world with others.
