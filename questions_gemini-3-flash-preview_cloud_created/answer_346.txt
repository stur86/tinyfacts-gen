In games where you hit a ball with a long stick, one team has to wait in the large green area. This team is "fielding." To field means to try and stop the ball after it is hit. The people on this team want to catch the ball and bring it back as fast as they can.

When the ball is hit into the air, the people on the team run toward it. They try to catch it before it hits the ground. If they catch it, the hitter is "out." If the ball is on the ground, they must grab it and throw it to a friend at a set spot. If the ball gets to the spot before the runner does, that person is also out.

Fielding can be hard because the ball moves very fast. People on the team wear a big, thick cover on one hand. This cover is often made from the skin of an animal. It helps them catch the ball so it does not hurt their fingers.

There are different spots in the field. Some people stay near the middle. They must have fast hands to catch balls that hit the ground and jump up. Others stay far away in the back of the area. They must be able to run a long way and throw the ball very far. Everyone on the team must work together to stop the other team from getting points.
