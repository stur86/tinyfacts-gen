Answering is what you do when someone asks you a question. If your friend asks, "Where are you going?", and you say, "I am going home," you have answered them. You give them the facts they want to know.

You can answer with your mouth and your voice. But you can also answer with your body. If someone asks if you want some water, you can nod your head. This is an answer too. 

Sometimes a computer or a phone can answer for us. When your phone rings, you pick it up to answer. This means you want to listen to what the other person is saying. If you do not answer, the phone will keep ringing.

Doctors answer when someone is hurt or sick. This means they go to help the person who is in trouble. They are responding to a need. 

In school, your teacher might ask you a hard question. You think about it in your brain and then you say the answer. If the answer is right, you feel good. If it is wrong, you can try again.

To answer is to give back what was asked for. It is an important part of a conversation between people. When you answer, you show that you are listening and that you care about what was said. If no one answers, the person waiting can feel sad or alone.
