When something is first, it is at the very beginning. Nothing comes before it in time or in a line.

Think about numbers. We start with one. One is the first number. If you are standing in a line to buy food, being first means you are at the front. You are the one the person behind the counter talks to before anyone else.

In a race, the person who is the fastest and gets to the end before the others is first. People often think this is the most important position to be in.

We have many firsts in our lives. A baby says its first word. A child takes its first step. These moments are very important because they only happen once. You will always remember the first time you did something amazing, like driving a car or going to a new city.

Being first can be hard. The first person to go to a far place or try a new thing is a leader. They have to find the way where no one has gone before. They do not have anyone to follow, so they must not be afraid.

In a book, the first part is where everything starts. It tells you who the people are and what is happening. Without the first part, the rest of the book would not make sense.

Even the world has firsts. The first light of the sun in the morning tells us that a new day has begun. Being first makes you the start of everything that follows.
