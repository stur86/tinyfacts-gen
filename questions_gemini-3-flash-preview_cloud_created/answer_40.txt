An arm is a long part of the human body. Most people have two of them. They hang from the top sides of your chest. This top place where the arm meets the body is the shoulder.

The arm can do many things because of a part in the middle. This middle part allows the arm to move toward you. Because of this, you can reach your face, eat food, or brush your hair. If the arm did not move this way, it would stay straight all the time.

At the end of the arm is the hand. Hands are very good. They have fingers that help you pick up tiny pieces of stuff or hold a thing to write.

Inside your arm, there are hard parts that give it form. There are also parts that get tight to help the arm move. On the outside, everything is covered in skin.

You use your arms for lots of work and fun. You use them to throw a ball, lift a heavy bag, or wave hello to a friend. They are also very good for giving a hug to someone.
