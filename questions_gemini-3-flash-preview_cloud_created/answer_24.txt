To amaze someone is to make them feel a big surprise. It happens when you do something that people did not think was possible. Imagine a boy who can jump very high. When people see him, their eyes get wide and their mouths open. They can not believe what they are seeing.

This feeling happens in the brain and the heart. Sometimes, we are amazed by things in the world. The sun going down can make the sky pink and red. A tiny animal can carry food that is much bigger than its body. 

A person can also amaze others by being very kind. If you help a stranger when they are in trouble, it can amaze people. It shows you have a big heart. Being amazed makes us feel happy and keeps us looking for the good in the world.
