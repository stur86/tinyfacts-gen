A flash is a very bright light that comes and goes very quickly. It happens in the sky during a time with rain and loud noises. This light is very strong and hot. It moves through the air faster than anything else.

People also use a flash to take a picture. If a room is dark, you can't see the faces of your friends in a picture. So, you use a small thing that makes a quick, bright light. This light fills the room for a moment so the picture box can see everything. Most people carry a flash every day in their pocket because their phones have one. If the flash is very bright, it can hurt your eyes. You might see tiny spots for a minute after the light is gone.

You can also say something is a flash if it is very fast. A boy might run in a flash to get his ball. A small animal might fly in a flash across the sky. It means something happened in a tiny bit of time, like a blink of your eye.
