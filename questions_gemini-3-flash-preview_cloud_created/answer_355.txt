To find something means you have it now, but you did not have it before. Sometimes you lose a thing you love, like your keys or a book. You look in every room. You look under the bed and behind the chair. You feel worried. Then, your eyes see the thing. You feel happy. This is finding.

Sometimes we find things we were not looking for. We walk in the woods and see a pretty rock or a small thing that grows on the ground. This is a surprise. It makes the day better. 

We can also find people. You might find a new friend at school. You talk and realize you like the same games. Or, you might find someone you love. This means you meet them and decide you want to be near them all the time. 

Finding is also about ideas. A person who looks at the stars might find a new world far away. A person who works with computers might find a way to fix a problem. These are big finds that help many people. 

When you find something, you add it to your life. It can be a small thing in your pocket or a big idea in your brain. Finding things makes us feel like we are moving forward. It takes us from not knowing to knowing.
