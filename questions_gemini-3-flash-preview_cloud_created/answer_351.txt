When you say you want to figure something out, you mean you are trying to understand it. Often, there is a problem or a question. You do not have the answer yet. Your brain works hard to find the reason why something happened or how a thing works. It is like taking many small pieces and putting them together to see the whole picture.

Here is one way to think about it. Imagine you have a computer. It does not work. You look at it for a long time. You check the parts. You think about what you know. Suddenly, you see what is wrong. You fix it. You figured it out!

You can also figure a person out. This is much harder than a computer. People have many things in their head that they hide. You watch how they act. You listen to the words they say. You try to tell what they will do next. When you figure someone out, you understand who they really are inside. You know why they are angry or why they laugh. It helps you live with others in a better way. Fact: sometimes it takes many years to really figure someone out, because people can change.
