Back is a word that means many things. We use it in many ways.

First, it is a part of your body. It is the large area behind your chest, between your neck and your bottom. You can feel the hard parts inside your back. People often carry a bag on their back when they go to school. If you sit for a long time, your back might hurt.

We also use this word to talk about where things are. The back of a house is often where you find a quiet area with trees. In a car, the back is where the children usually sit. A chair has a back so you can lean against it and relax.

Next, you can move back. This means moving toward what is behind you. If a car moves back, it goes the way it just came from or moves without turning around. You might step back if you are afraid of a big dog.

We can talk about time using this word too. "Back then" means a long time ago. It is about the past. You can look back at your memories from when you were a child.

Also, you can give something back. If you take a book from a friend, you must give it back when you finish reading it. This means the book returns to the person who owns it.

Finally, to back someone is to help them. If your friend has a problem, you can back them. This means you agree with them and help them. You tell them that you are on their side.
