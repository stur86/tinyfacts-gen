Being able means you can do things. If you are not able to do something, it might be because you do not have the power or the right things to help you. To help someone become able means you give them a chance or a thing that helps them act.

Think of this: a person may have trouble moving their body. We can help them be able to go to many places by making ways for their chairs to move up and into a building. A different person might not be able to see words on a paper. We can use a computer that reads the words to them so they can hear them. Now they are able to know what the book says.

Making someone able is about taking away the things that stop them. It is also about giving them the right things so they can do what they want. When everyone is able to do things, the world becomes a better place for all of us.
