When you block something, you stop it from going through a way. It is like putting a big box in a hallway. No one can pass until the box is moved.

Walls can block the wind or the light. A closed door blocks people from entering a room. If a large tree falls on the road, it blocks the cars. The people in the car must wait or find a different way to go.

In games with a ball, a person playing might block. They use their body to stop the ball from reaching a place. A tall person can block a shot by using their hands to push the ball away. This helps their team stay in the game.

People also block each other on computers and phones. If a person is being mean or annoying, you can block them. After you do this, you will not see their words or their pictures anymore. They can not call you or send you notes. It is a way to make your space feel safe.

In a show with people who act, blocking means something else. The actor must know where to walk and stand. The manager tells them when to move so the people watching can see their faces. They plan every step so the story looks good.
