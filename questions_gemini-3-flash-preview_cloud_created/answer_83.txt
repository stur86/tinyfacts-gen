A bit is a very small part of how a computer works. It is the smallest piece of what a computer knows.

A bit can only be one of two ways. Imagine a light in a room. The light can be on, or the light can be off. It can not be anything else. This is how a bit works.

We often call these two ways "one" and "nothing".

One bit does not tell you much alone. But when you put many bits together, they can show you everything. A group of bits can show a number. Another group of bits can show a letter in a word.

If you have many, many bits, you can have a picture of your family or a movie. Inside the computer, these bits are made using power. Either the power is there, or it is not there.

Everything you do on a computer, like looking at pictures, playing a game, or writing, is just a lot of these tiny bits moving around. It is amazing that such a thing can build the whole world you see when you use your computer.
