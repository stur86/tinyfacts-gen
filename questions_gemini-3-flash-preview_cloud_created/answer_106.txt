To bottle something can mean two different things.

The first way is easy to see. You put water or another drink into a glass thing. You close the top so it stays in. This keeps the water clean and ready for later. We use these glass things every day.

The second way is about what happens in your head. Sometimes you have a bad feeling. You may be very angry, sad, or afraid. You do not want anyone to know. So you hide the feeling deep inside your body. You act like everything is okay and stay silent. This is like putting a big feeling in a small bottle and closing the top very tight.

Doing this for a long time can be hard. The force inside you grows and grows. It is like pushing too much air into a ball. One day, you might not be able to hold it anymore. Suddenly, the bottle breaks and the feeling comes out. You might scream or cry a lot. It is usually better to talk to a friend.

Some people also say "you bottled it" when you get scared. Maybe you are playing a game and you are about to be the first one. But then you think too much and you get afraid. Because you are afraid, you do something wrong and you lose. This is a sad way to lose because you were so close to being at the top.
