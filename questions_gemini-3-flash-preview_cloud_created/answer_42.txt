You use this word to talk about where things are or how they move. It is a very good word.

If you walk in a round way, you are going around something. Think of this: the world goes around the sun once every year. It moves in a round way that never ends. A dog might chase the end of his body by running around and around on the floor.

You can also use this word to mean near a place. If you are looking for things you lost, you look around your room. You look in many spots to find them. If you tell a friend that you are "around," it means you are close by.

This word can also talk about numbers. If you say a movie is around two hours long, it means it is almost two hours. It might be a little more or a little less. It is not exactly two hours.

You can also use it to talk about how you face. If you turn around, you turn to look at what was behind you. This is a good way to see if a friend is following you.
