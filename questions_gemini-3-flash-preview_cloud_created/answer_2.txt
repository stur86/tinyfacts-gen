To accept something or someone means to say that it is real. It is to stop fighting against what is happening or who a person is. Sometimes we wish things were different. We might feel angry or sad because a situation is not what we wanted. But the truth is, we can not change what has already happened. When we accept, we stop trying to change the past.

This does not mean we have to like everything. You can accept that it is raining even if you wanted to go outside and play. You are just admitting that the rain is there. This helps your mind feel calm. If you stay angry at the rain, you are only tired and sad.

Accepting a person is also important. People are all different. Some people talk a lot. Some are very quiet. Some do things that we do not think are right. To accept them is to see them as they are. You do not try to force them to change into someone else. It is like looking at a tree. You do not get angry at a tree because it is not something else. You see it as it is.

We also need to accept our own selves. We all have things we are good at and things we are bad at. Accepting who you are is the first step toward being happy and growing into a better person. When we accept things, we find a way to move forward.
