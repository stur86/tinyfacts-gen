A block is a hard thing with straight sides. Most often, it has six sides and looks like a box. These things can be small or very large.

Small blocks are often for kids. Children play with them to build tall things or tiny houses. They are made from wood or other hard stuff. They often have bright colors like red, blue, and green. When you put many of them together, you can make something new. If you do not take care, the tall things you build might fall down with a loud noise!

A city block is different. It is an area of land in a town. It usually has four streets around it. There are often many houses or shops in that area. People can walk all the way around the area to get back to where they started. If you walk past some houses and then turn a corner, and do this four times, you have walked around one block.

You can also use the word block when you stop something from moving. If a big tree falls across the road, it blocks the cars. The cars can't go. Sometimes, if you stand in front of the tv, you block the picture for someone else. This might make them angry!
