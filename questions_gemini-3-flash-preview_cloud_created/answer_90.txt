To blink is to close and open your eyes very fast. You do this all the time, even when you do not think about it. It happens many times every minute.

Your eyes need to stay wet so they do not hurt. When you blink, the skin over your eyes moves down and up. This puts a little bit of water on them. This water keeps the front of your eye clean. It takes away tiny things that should not be there.

Blinking also keeps your eyes safe. If a tiny flying animal or a bit of wood moves toward your face, your eyes will shut quickly. They do this before you even know they are doing it. If a light is very bright, you might also blink a lot to help your eyes.

Most people blink about ten or twenty times every minute. This means you blink many, many hundreds of times in one day. Older people blink more than babies do. Sometimes, a person might close only one eye while keeping the other eye open. They might do this to be funny or to tell a friend something without speaking.

When you sleep, your eyes stay closed for a long time. This gives them a long rest. But when you are not asleep, you must keep blinking to see well.
