To bite means you use your teeth to press on something. You can also use them to cut through something. Your teeth are the white, hard things inside your mouth. You use them many times every day.

Most of the time, people bite to eat. You put food in your mouth and your teeth come together. This breaks the food into tiny bits. This makes it easy to send the food down to your stomach.

Animals bite for different reasons. Tiny animals might bite your skin to get a little bit of your blood. This can make your skin red. It can make you feel like you need to rub it. Large animals might bite if they are afraid or angry. Their teeth can be very good at cutting and can cause a lot of pain. They might also bite to catch another animal to eat.

Some people bite themselves without thinking. You may bite your lip when you are thinking hard. A baby might bite a person because they are still learning how to act. Some people even bite the hard parts at the ends of their fingers when they are nervous.
