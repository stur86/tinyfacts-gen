To beat something or someone can mean many different things.

One way to beat someone is when you play a game. If you play a game and you do better than the other people, you have beaten them. You are the one who did the best.

Another way to beat is to hit something many times. You might beat a soft thing from the floor to get the bad stuff out of it. You hit it with a long piece of wood. You can also beat a ball with a piece of wood in a game.

A very important way to beat is inside your body. Your heart beats all the time. It moves blood through your body. This is the sound your chest makes. If you are afraid or if you run fast, your heart will beat even faster.

In the kitchen, you can beat things you eat. If you have some food, you might hit it fast with a small thing. This makes the food join together so you can make sweet things to eat.

Finally, if you beat a problem, it means you found a way to be better than the trouble. If it is a very hot day, you can go into a cool house to beat the hot sun. You did something so the hot air does not bother you.
