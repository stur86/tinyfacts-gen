Something that annoys is a thing that bothers you. It is often not a big problem. It is just small things that make you feel a little bit angry.

Many things can annoy a person. A fly in your room can be annoying because it moves around your face. A loud noise from a car can be annoying while you sleep. Waiting in a long line to buy food can also be annoying.

You might feel this way if someone talks while you are watching a movie. Or you might feel it if your computer works very slowly. Small things like these can make you frown or sigh.

When you are annoyed, you want the thing to stop. You might try to fix the problem. You might shut the window to stop the noise. You might walk away to be alone if other people are bothering you.

Everyone feels this way sometimes. It is normal. If you take a breath and stay calm, the feeling usually goes away.
