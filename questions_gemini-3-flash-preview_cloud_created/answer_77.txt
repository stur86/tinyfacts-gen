To bell something is a way to make sure you can hear it. Usually, you put a small round thing on it. This thing makes a noise when it moves. People often do this to their cats. Cats like to catch flying animals or other small things. If a cat has a bell around its neck, the other animals hear the noise and fly away.

There is a very old story about this. A group of small animals lived in a house with a big cat. The cat was very good at catching them. The animals met to talk. They had a plan. They said, "Let us put a bell on the cat. That way, we will hear it coming and we can hide."

Everyone thought this was a great idea. But then, one old animal asked a question. "Who will put the bell on the cat?" No one said anything. It was a good plan, but no person or animal wanted to do it because it was not safe. Now, when people have a good plan that no one is able to do, they might talk about this story.

Also, in some places, to bell someone means to call them on the phone. If a friend says they will "give you a bell," they are not giving you a small round thing. They are saying they will talk to you using a phone later. Many people talk this way in some parts of the world.
