To blue something can mean a few different things.

One way is about a person and how they feel. If you feel blue, you are sad. You might want to be alone or cry. You are not happy. 

Another way is about making white clothes look very bright. When white clothes get old, they can start to look like the color of the sun. If you add a tiny bit of blue color while cleaning them, they look very clean and white again. Your brain thinks the clothes are a better white than they actually are.

A third way is about making hard grey things, like guns or things for work. People make them a dark blue or black color. They do this by making the grey stuff very hot or by using different water. This helps the hard stuff stay strong. Without this, the air and water would make the grey stuff turn red and break. The dark color keeps it safe so it lasts for a long time.
