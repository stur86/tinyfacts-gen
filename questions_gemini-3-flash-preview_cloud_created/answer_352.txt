A fill is a short bit of music. It is used to join two different parts of a song. Most of the time, a person makes a fill by hitting things that make loud sounds very quickly. This often happens on things that a person hits with sticks.

This helps the person who listens know that a change is coming. To show this, the music might be about to get louder. A fill might also happen before a person starts to use their voice again. Without these short bits, a song might feel the same for too long. These bits of sound can make the person who hears them feel excited.

A fill can be very short, like just one or two quick hits. It can also be many sounds that show how well a person can play. It is a way to move the music from one part to the next part so that the change does not surprise the listener too much.
