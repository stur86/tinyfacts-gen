A bell is a thing that makes a long, loud sound. It is made of a hard, strong stuff. This stuff is often bright and cold to touch. Most bells look like a cup turned over. Inside the bell, there is a small piece that hangs from the top. When you shake the bell, the small piece hits the sides of the cup. This makes the hard stuff shake very fast. Your ears hear this shaking as a clear sound.

Some bells are tiny. You can hold them in your hand. Others are huge and heavy, even bigger than a car! These big bells are put in high places in a large building. People use these bells to tell the time or to give a warning. In the old days, bells told everyone when to wake up or come together to talk. Bells also call children to learn at school. Many homes have a small bell near the door. It makes a sound to tell you that someone has arrived. When a man and a woman get married, bells ring to show that people are happy. They can also ring slowly when someone dies.

One very old bell that many people know has a long crack in it. It broke a long time ago and does not ring well anymore. Still, people visit it because it is important to their land. Bells can also make music. Large bells make a low sound, and tiny bells make a high sound. When you have large bells and small bells, you can play a beautiful song with them.
