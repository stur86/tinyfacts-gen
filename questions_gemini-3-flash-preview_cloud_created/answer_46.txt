To ask is to use your words to find an answer. You do this when you want to know more about something. You might have a question in your brain and you want to let it out.

Everyone asks things. Small children ask many questions because the world is new to them. They might ask why the sky is blue or how an animal can fly. This is how they learn about life.

You can ask many different things. You can ask for a fact, like "What time is it?" You can ask for help if a job is too hard for you to do alone. You can also ask for something you need, like a drink of water or some food.

Today, we do not only ask people. We also ask computers. We type our questions and the computer finds the answer for us. It is like having someone who knows everything in your pocket.

When you ask someone a question, it is good to be nice. Using words like "please" can help a lot. It shows you care about the other person. After you ask, you must listen to what they say. Listening is just as important as asking. If you do not listen, the answer can not help you.
