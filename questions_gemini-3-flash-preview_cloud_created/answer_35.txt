It is not always easy to say if something has life. You and your friends have life. Your dog and the trees have life. A rock does not have life. A car does not have life, even if it moves.

Things that are living usually do a few things. First, they grow and change. They may start small and become bigger as time goes on. They also need to get power. You get power from eating food. A tree gets power from the sun. They use this power to move, grow, and keep their bodies working.

Another thing is that living things make more of themselves. They have babies or start new, small things that grow into big ones. This way, life can continue even after the first one is gone.

Living things also feel the world around them. If it is too hot, they might move to a cool place. If something hurts them, they try to get away.

Inside, all living things are made of very tiny bags called cells. These tiny bags are like small rooms where all the work of life happens. Some small things are only one tiny bag. You are made of very many tiny bags working together.
