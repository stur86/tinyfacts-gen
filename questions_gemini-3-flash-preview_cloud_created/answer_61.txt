A bag is a thing used to hold other things. It can be small or big. We use it to move things from one place to another.

Long ago, people made bags from the skin of animals. Today, we make bags from many things. Some are made of paper. We use paper bags for food. Some bags are made of the same things as our clothes. These bags are strong. We can use them many times.

There are many kinds of bags. A school bag is a bag that a child wears on their back. It holds books and papers. A small bag that a person carries in a hand holds money. A very big bag with round things that turn is used for trips to far places.

Bags help us because we only have two hands. With a bag, we can carry many things at once. We can put our food and other things inside. Some bags have a top that we can shut so things do not fall out. They might have a long line of small teeth to shut them, or small round things that we push through small spaces.
