To black someone is to say they are bad and should not be part of a group. You tell other people not to work with them or talk to them. This usually happens when a group of people agree that one person did a bad thing. They may write down the name of that person on a paper so that everyone knows to stay away from them.

If a person is blacked, they can't get a job in their city anymore. Other businesses will see the name and will not allow them to enter. It is like being shut out of a kitchen or a house while everyone else is inside eating.

Sometimes this happens because a person was really bad. Maybe they lied or took money that was not their own. In this case, the group wants to stay safe. Other times, a person is blacked just because they have a different idea. When this happens, it is very hard for them. They may have to move to a far place to start their life again.

You can also black a thing or a place. This means you say you will not use it or buy it. If many people decide a store is acting bad, they might all agree to never go there. They tell their friends to stay away too. This is a way for people to show they are angry and want things to change.
