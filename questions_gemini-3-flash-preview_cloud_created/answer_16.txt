To say a thing is all means that every piece of it is there. Nothing is missing. It is the whole thing from the start to the end.

Imagine you have a bag of sweets. If you eat all of them, there are no sweets left in the bag. The bag is empty. You did not leave one piece for another person.

When we talk about people, all means every person in a group. If all the children in a school are happy, then not one child is sad. Everyone has a smile.

In a story, all is the whole book. You did not just read the start. You read every word until the very last word. You know everything that happened.

Sometimes we use this word to talk about how much we care. If you love someone with all your heart, it means there is no room to love anyone else. You give that person every bit of your love.

It can also mean that something is finished or covered. If a house is all red, then every wall is that color. There is no white, blue, or green in any place on the house.

So, all is a way to say nothing is left out. It is the entire group or the whole piece of something.
