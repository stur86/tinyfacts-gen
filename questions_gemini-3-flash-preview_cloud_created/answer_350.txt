A figure is a form that you can see. It is made of points and lines. It can be on a paper, or it can be a thing with a body that you can hold. 

When it has no body, it is a figure on a piece of paper. It might be a round form or a form with sides. One usual form has four sides that are the same. Another form has three sides and three corners. These figures could be the front of a book or the top of a table. 

A figure can also be large and have a body. These are things like a ball or a box. You can see them from any side. A house is a large figure. A car is also a figure. Even humans are figures with many parts. 

Figures are in every place. The sun is a very large round figure in the sky. Stars are also figures that look like tiny points of light when we look up at night. 

In school, students study these forms. They look at the lines to see how long they are. They also look at how much area is inside the figure. This helps people plan and build. If you know about figures, you can build a house or a computer. Every time you draw or look at a thing, you are seeing a figure.
