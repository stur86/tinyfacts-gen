When you hear this word, it usually means making something big fall to the ground. Most of the time, people say it when they talk about cutting down trees.

If a person wants to build a house, they need wood. They go to a place with many trees. They use a heavy thing that can cut wood. They must work very carefully. They cut a small piece out of one side of the tree. They decide on the side where they want the tree to hit the ground. Then they cut from the other side.

The tree begins to lean. Soon, it starts to move fast. It hits the ground with a very loud noise. The ground might even shake! The person has to shout to warn others so they do not get hurt. This is how you get wood to make things.

You can also use this word for people. In a fight, if one person hits another person so hard that they fall down, it means they made them fall. It shows the person is very strong.

It is about using force to change something that is standing. It takes work and it is often not safe, but it is how we get the stuff we need to build our world.
