When you bar something, you use a long piece of wood or hard stuff to stop it from moving. If you put this across a door, it stays shut and people can not get inside. This makes a house safe. People also put long parts on windows so others can not climb through the glass. You might see bars on a box for an animal to keep it from running away.

To bar a person means they are not allowed to be in a place or do a thing. If someone acts bad at a shop, the owner may bar them. The person can not go back inside that shop anymore.

Sometimes, a person is barred from a game or a job. If they did not follow the orders or the right way to act, they might be told they can not play or work there. It is a way to keep things right and safe for everyone else.
