To flash means to change the way a computer works deep inside. A computer has a small part that holds its most important ideas. These ideas stay there even when you turn the power off. Usually, a person does not touch these ideas. But sometimes, the people who built the computer find a way to make it better. They send you a new group of ideas for how the box should act.

When you flash the computer, you put these new ideas into the small part. First, the computer clears its memory. It wipes its mind clean. Then, it writes the new things it needs to know. This takes a short time. While this is happening, you must stay still and not touch anything. Do not turn the power off!

If the power goes out, the computer will get confused. It was in the middle of learning but then it lost its way. It will have no ideas left in its brain. The computer will not be able to start anymore. It will be like a heavy rock that does nothing for anyone. It is important to wait until it is all done. Then you will have a better computer.
