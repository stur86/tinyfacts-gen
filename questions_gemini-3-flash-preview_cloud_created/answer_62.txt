To bag something often means to put it into a bag. When you go to a store to buy food, a worker might put your food in a bag so you can carry it home easily. You might also bag your clothes when you go to another place.

But the word can mean other things, too. If someone says they bagged a thing, it often means they got something they wanted. If a person finishes first in a hard game, they might say they bagged the first place. If someone gets a job they really liked, they have bagged it. This means they have it now and it is their thing.

In some places, if you bag a person, it means you are saying bad things about them. You might laugh at their hair or their clothes. This is not a kind thing to do, and it can make people feel sad.

If the police catch a person who did something wrong, they might say they bagged them. This means the person can not run away anymore because they were caught and taken away.

Also, if you are working very hard and you feel very tired, you might say, Bag it! This means you are going to stop doing the work and go home or do something else instead. It is like you are throwing the work away into a bag to forget about it for a while.
