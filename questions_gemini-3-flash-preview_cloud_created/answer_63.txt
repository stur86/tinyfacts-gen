A ball is a round thing. It is like the sun or a part of your eye. It does not have corners. It can roll on the floor easily.

Many games use balls. You can throw them with your hand or kick them with your foot. Some balls are big and full of air. When you drop them, they jump back up. This is fun to watch.

Other balls are small and hard. You might hit them with a long piece of wood. Some are white and some are green. There is even a ball that is not totally round. It is long and has two ends. People run with it and throw it to their friends.

A long time ago, children did not have the balls we have today. They made them from old clothes or from parts of animals. Now, big businesses make many of them at once. We use colors like red, blue, and white. Balls help us play and have fun together.
