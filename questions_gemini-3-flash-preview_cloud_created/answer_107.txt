A bottom is the part of your body that you sit on. It is at the back of you. It is under your back and above your legs. It is made of thick, soft stuff and strong parts that help you move.

Humans have larger bottoms than many other animals. This is because we stand on two feet. The strong parts inside our bottoms help us stand up and walk. When you sit down, the soft part covers the hard parts of your body so you do not hurt.

There are many names for this part. You can call it your behind. Some people call it your ass.

The word is also used for the part of a thing that is at the lowest end. A bottle has a bottom. If you go deep into the large water, you will find the ground at the bottom of the world. It is the place where things stop falling.
