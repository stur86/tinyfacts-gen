To begin is to start. It is the first step you take when you do a new thing.

Each morning, the sun comes up. That is a beginning. The air is cool. The day is new.

A tiny thing in the ground is the start of a tree. It is very small. Then it grows and becomes large.

A baby is the beginning of a person. A baby learns to move. Then they learn to walk and speak.

When you open a book, you begin a story. You do not know what will happen. This is exciting.

Sometimes starting is hard. You may be afraid. You might worry that you will do it wrong. But you must try. If you do not take the first step, nothing new can happen.

An end can be a beginning too. When one thing finishes, another thing starts. Like when a school year ends, the warm summer begins.

To begin is to look forward to the time that is coming. It is to have hope for what you can do.
