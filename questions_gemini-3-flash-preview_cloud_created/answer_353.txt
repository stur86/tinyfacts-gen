To fill something means to put stuff inside it until there is no more space.

Think about a cup. You put water into the cup. Soon the water is at the top. Now the cup is full. You have filled it. You can do this with many things. You fill your bag with books for school. You fill a box with old clothes to give away.

You can also fill people. When you want to eat, you fill your stomach with food. Then you do not want to eat anymore. But you can fill a person in other ways too. You can fill the heart of a person with love and a happy feeling. This makes them feel great.

Sometimes a noise fills a room. If a child screams, the sound goes into every corner. The sound is in every place. It fills the air. Warm light from the sun can also fill a room in the morning.

You can even fill a spot in a group. If a team needs a new player and you join them, you fill that spot. You are the one who was needed to make the team complete.

One more thing: You can fill your mind. When you read and learn, you fill your brain with new ideas. This is a very good way to grow.
