A finger is a part of your hand. Most people have ten fingers. There are five on each hand. One finger is short and thick. It is very important because it can touch the other fingers. This helps you grab things. The other fingers are longer. They help you hold a cup or a thing you use to write.

Inside the finger, there are hard white parts. These parts keep the finger strong. There are other parts that let the finger move. You can pull your fingers in to make a ball with your hand. On the end of each finger is a hard part. It helps keep the end of your finger safe.

The skin on your fingers has very tiny lines. Each person has different lines. These lines can help other people know who you are if you touch something.

Fingers are very good at feeling things. They tell you if something is hot or cold. They tell you if something is soft or hard. Your fingers help you do many things every day. You use them to type on a computer, to eat food, and to play music.
