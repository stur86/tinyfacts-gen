To arrive is to get to the end of a trip. You were in one place, and you wanted to be in another place. You move from one to the other. You may walk, or you may use a car or a bus. You go along the road for a time. Finally, you reach the spot you were looking for. Now you are there. This is arriving.

Arriving can be a happy thing. Think about when you see someone you love after you have been away. You see them and you feel very glad. You drop your bags on the floor. You give them a huge hug. This is a great way to arrive.

Arriving also happens in our lives. You might work hard for many years. You want to reach a point where you feel you have done something important. When you finally reach that place in your life, people say you have arrived. It means you are now the person you wanted to become.

Sometimes you arrive early. This means you reach the place before you were supposed to be there. Sometimes you arrive late. This means you reach the place after the right time. If you arrive late, people might be waiting and looking for you.

Leaving is one thing. But arriving is the part where you finally come home or reach your new place. It is when you stop going and start being where you are.
