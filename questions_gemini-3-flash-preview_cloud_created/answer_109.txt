A box is a thing that has sides and space inside. Most boxes have six sides. They are often formed where all sides are the same, or they have some sides that are longer than others. People make them from thick paper, wood, or other hard things.

You use a box to keep your things together. When you have too many things you play with on the floor, you can put them in a box. When you want to send a present to a friend, you put the present in a box and wrap it with pretty paper.

If you are moving to a new house, you will need many big boxes. You put your books, clothes, and kitchen things inside them. Then you can carry them easily or put them in a car.

Some boxes are very small. A tiny box might hold a ring for a finger. Other boxes are huge. Some are so big that a person can sit inside them. Children often like to play with empty boxes. They imagine the box is a house, a car, or a thing that moves on water.

Even animals like boxes. A cat will often jump into a box if you leave it on the floor. It likes the way the walls of the box surround it and make it feel safe.

A box has a bottom and sides. Most of the time, it also has a top part called a cover. You can open the cover to see what is inside and close it to keep things safe. Without boxes, it would be very hard to move things from one place to another.
