To admit something or someone means a few different things.

One way to admit is to tell the truth. Imagine you did something bad or wrong. Maybe you broke a glass in the kitchen. You might be afraid to tell your parents. But if you tell them, "Yes, I did it," you have admitted it. You say that it actually happened. Sometimes it is hard to admit when we are wrong, but it is important to do it.

Another way to admit is to let a person into a place. Imagine a school or a hospital. Not everyone can just go inside. The people who run the place have to let you in. When they say you can enter, they admit you. It means they are opening a door for you to be there.

You can also admit that something is true even if you don't like it. If you are in a fight with a friend, you might have to admit that they are right about one thing. It means you see the truth and you say it. Admitting things helps people understand each other.
