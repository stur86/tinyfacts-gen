To fix something is to make it act the right way again.

Imagine you have a thing you play with. You play with it every day. One day, the thing stops moving. It is broken. You feel sad. To fix the thing, you have to look inside. Maybe a small piece fell off. You use your hands to put the piece back. Now the thing moves again. It is fixed. This is easy because you can see the problem with your eyes.

It is harder to fix a human. If the leg of a person is hurt, a doctor can help. They use things to keep the leg straight. The person waits for many days. The body is amazing because it can make its own self well again from the inside.

But sometimes a person feels broken inside their heart or mind. This does not mean they have a space missing in their chest. It means they are very sad or they are afraid. You can not use things to fix a sad heart like you fix a thing you play with. To help, you can be a good friend. You can listen to their stories. You can sit with them in the dark until they feel better. You do not fix them. You help them to be strong again.

Is it good to try to fix everyone? Sometimes we try to change a person because we do not like how they act. We think they are wrong. But people are not like the things we play with. Every person is different. If we try to force a person to be different, we might hurt them. We should only try to help if it makes their life better and they want us to.

To fix something wrong you did is also important. If you say bad words to your mother, you have broken something between you. To fix it, you must tell the truth. You say you are sorry. You try to be nice next time. This fixes the love you share.
