A bite happens when you use your teeth to press into something. You use the hard white parts in your mouth to do this. People bite food to break it into small bits. This makes the food easy to eat.

Animals also bite for many reasons. A dog might bite a ball while playing. A dog might also bite if it is afraid or angry. This can hurt a lot. It can leave a mark on your skin. Sometimes it even makes blood come out. Some animals that live in the water use a bite to catch their dinner.

Tiny animals can bite people too. Some tiny animals fly and want to drink blood from your body. After they bite, your skin might feel like you need to rub it. It might cause a red spot to appear where they bit you.

Even the air can have a bite! On a very cold day, the air can feel strong against your face. People say the cold has a "bite" because it hurts a little, just like a real bite does.

Biting is an important thing for many living things. It helps them eat and stay safe. But you should take care with your teeth and not bite your friends!
