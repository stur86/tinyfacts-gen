This word helps you add more things to what you say. It is like the word "and" or "too." When you talk about a thing, and then you want to mention another thing, you can use this word. 

Think about your breakfast. You might say you ate some food. If you also drank coffee, you would say, "I drank coffee also." This tells the other person that you did both things. 

You can use it to help people understand you better. If you say you are happy, but you are also tired, it shows how you feel more easily. It makes your stories longer and fuller because you can add lots of parts. Sometimes you put it in the middle of your words, like "He is also tall." Other times, you can put it at the very start of a new part to add one more fact.
