A star is a huge ball of fire in the sky. We see many of them at night when the sky is dark. They are very, very far away. Our sun is also a star. It is the star that is closest to us. It gives our world light and keeps us warm during the day.

Stars are made of hot stuff that is like air. Inside a star, tiny pieces of things are being pushed together very hard. This makes a lot of power and keeps the star very hot. This power is what makes the star so bright.

Stars can be different colors. Some are blue, some are white, and some are red. They are much bigger than our world. Many stars are even much bigger than our sun. If our sun was as small as a ball you can hold in your hand, some stars would be as big as a house!

Stars live for a very long time, but they do not live always. When a star gets very old, it can break into many pieces. Those pieces go all over space. Everything in our world is made from these parts of old stars. Even the tiny pieces that make you were once inside a star! When you look at the stars at night, you are looking at where we all came from.
