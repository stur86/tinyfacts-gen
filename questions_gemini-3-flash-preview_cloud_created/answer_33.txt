An answer is what you give when someone asks you a question. When you want to know something, you ask. Then, the other person says something back. This is how we learn about the world and each other.

Some answers are not hard to find. If a friend asks if you want food, you can say "Yes" or "No". This is an easy answer. Other answers are very hard. If you ask why the sky is blue, you have to know a lot about the air and the light from the sun. You might need to look in a book or on a computer to find the facts.

Sometimes an answer is not a word. If your mom asks if you are done with your school work, you might just nod your head. That nod is an answer without words.

People look for answers to big problems. If a car will not start, a person looks for the reason. When they find out what is wrong and fix it, they have found the answer.

It is important to remember that not everything has an answer right now. There are many things we do not know yet. We continue to ask questions so we can find new answers.
