To baby someone means you act like that person is still a very small child. You do things for them that they are able to do alone. Maybe you are afraid they will get hurt, so you try to keep them too safe. You might give them everything they want. This can be good because it shows love. But it can also be bad if the person never learns how to do things by themselves.

People also baby things. If you have a new car, you might baby it. You drive it very slowly. You park it far away from other cars so no one hits it. You clean it all the time. You do not want it to get even one tiny mark. You handle it very carefully because it is important to you.

You can also baby a part of your body that is hurt. If you hurt your foot, you might walk very slowly. You do not step on it hard. You stay in bed until it feels better. This lets the body fix its own self without more trouble.
