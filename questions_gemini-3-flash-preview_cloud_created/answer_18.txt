"Almost" is the word we use when we are very close to some thing, but not quite there. If you are running to your home and you can see the door, you are almost home. You are not inside yet, but you will be in one second.

If you are drinking from a bottle of water and there is only one tiny bit left, the bottle is almost empty.

It also works with time. If you need to go to sleep at ten and it is only a few minutes before ten, it is almost time to sleep.

You can use it when you are doing something. If you are writing a long story and you are on the last word, you are almost finished. You are very near the end!

Sometimes we use it for things that did not happen. If you trip but you do not fall down on the ground, you can say you almost fell. It was very close! Your body started to go down, but then you stayed up.

If you are trying to catch a ball and it touches your hand but then falls away, you almost caught it. You had the chance to catch it, and you nearly did.

It is a word for when something is just a little bit short of being done or being real.
