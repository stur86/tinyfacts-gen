An act is a group of words that tell people what they must do in a place. It starts as an idea. Someone might want to change how things work or keep people safe.

A group of people picked by others meets in a big building. They talk about the idea for many hours. Some people like the idea, and some do not. They might change some of the words to make more people happy.

After they talk, the group decides if the idea should be an act. If most of them say the idea is good, it moves forward. Often, a top leader must also read the paper and write their name on it. When the leader signs it, the idea becomes a real act.

Everyone must follow the act. If someone does not follow the words in the act, they might get in trouble. They might have to talk to the police or pay money.

Acts can be about many things. There are acts about how to use cars on the road. There are acts about the food we eat to make sure it is good for us. These acts help keep things in order so that life is better for everyone.
