To fine someone means to make them pay money because they did a thing that is not allowed. It is a way to show a person they did something wrong without sending them away to a room with bars.

One usual way to get a fine is when using a car. If you drive much faster than the sign says, a police man might stop you. He will give you a paper that says you must pay money to the city. If you park your car in a place where it should not be, you will also have to pay a fine.

You can also get a fine at school or at the place where people take books for a little while. If you keep a book for many weeks and do not bring it back when you should, you must pay money. This helps the people who run the place buy more books for everyone.

Sometimes, a group that makes things will get a fine. If they make the air or the water not clean, the people who run the land will make them pay a lot of money. This is done to make sure the group follows the ways that tell them how to act. It helps keep the world safe for everyone.

If you get a fine, it is best to pay it quickly. If you do not pay, you might get into more trouble later. It is much better to follow the ways of the land so you can keep your money for yourself.
