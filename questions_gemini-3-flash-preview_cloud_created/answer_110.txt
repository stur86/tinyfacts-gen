To box can mean two different things.

One way is a game where two people fight. They stand in an area with four sides. They have big soft things on their hands so they do not hurt each other too much. They try to hit the head or chest of the other person. They are not allowed to use their feet. They are also not allowed to hit the other person when they are on the floor. If one person falls and can not get up before another person says the numbers from one to ten, the other person beats them. If the fight ends and both are still standing, some people decide who was best.

Another way is to put things inside a box. A box is a thing with many sides and corners. People use boxes to keep things safe. When you want to move to another house, you box your stuff. You put your books and clothes inside. This makes it easier to carry many things at once.

Sometimes, a person may feel boxed in. This does not mean they are in a real box. It means they feel like they have no space. It feels like they are in a tiny room and can not escape or change what is happening.
