"Few" means a small number of things. It is not many.

If you have a big bag of balls, and you take out only three or four, you have a few. It is more than none. It is more than one. But it is still a small group. You can tell how many there are very quickly.

The meaning of the word is different for different things. If you have five friends, that is a few friends. But if only five people live in a whole city, that is almost no one!

Sometimes, saying "few" can feel different. If you say "I have few books," it might mean you want more books to read. If you say "I have a few books," it sounds like you are happy with the books you have.

Think about the sky at night. Often, you can see many stars. But if the night is not clear, you might only see a few. You can see them, but they are far from each other and easy to tell how many there are.
