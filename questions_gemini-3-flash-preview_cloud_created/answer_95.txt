To blood someone is to have them do a hard thing for the first time. It is an old way that people used when they went to kill animals for food. When a young person kills an animal for the first time, an older person takes the blood from the animal. The older person puts the red blood on the face of the young person.

This shows everyone that the young person is not a child anymore. They can now help to get food for the group. This also happens with animals like dogs or horses. People might let a dog eat some of an animal after the dog catches it. This makes the dog want to catch more. Also, they might put a horse in its first race to get it ready for more races.

Today, people use this word for other things too. If a person starts a new job that is very hard or makes them afraid, they might get blooded. It means they have faced the hard parts of the job. Now they are ready to be a part of the team because they know how it feels to work hard. They are not new anymore. They have become part of the group.
