A boy is a young human. One day, he will grow up and become a man. A boy starts his life as a small baby. As the years go by, he learns how to walk, talk, and play with other kids.

When a boy is growing up, his body changes. This is an important time. His voice will get much deeper. He will grow hair on his face and his chest. He will also become much taller and stronger. During this time, he might feel a bit strange or confused because of all these changes.

Boys can like many different things. Some love to run fast and play games with balls or cars. Others like to build things with their hands or work on computers. Some boys like to read books and draw pictures. There is no one way to be a boy.

In the past, people said boys should only wear some clothes or like the color blue. Now, we know that a boy can like the color pink or have long hair if he wants. He can be loud, or he can be quiet and act gently. A boy is a person with his own ideas.
