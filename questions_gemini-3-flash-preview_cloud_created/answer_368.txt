Sometimes a person has a body that starts to move in a way they can't control. This is a fit. It happens because of the brain. The brain is the part inside your head that thinks and tells your body what to do. Sometimes the brain gets confused.

Inside the brain, there are usually many small bits of power moving around. These bits of power tell your arms to move or your eyes to see. But during a fit, too many of these bits of power act at once. It is like too much power in one place at the same time.

When this happens, the person might fall down. Their body might shake a lot. They might not hear you or know you are there. Their eyes might look away. They might even bite their tongue. Some people don't shake. Instead, they just look into space for a short time and don't answer when you talk to them.

A fit can happen for many reasons. Sometimes it happens because a person feels very hot when they are sick. Sometimes it happens because of bright lights that flash fast. Other times, we don't know why it happens.

After it stops, the person usually feels very tired. They might be confused and not remember what happened. They might need to sleep for a long time.

Doctors can help people who have fits. They can give them things to take so the fits don't happen as often. If you see someone having a fit, the most important thing is to keep them safe. Make sure they don't hit their head on anything hard. Stay with them until they wake up and feel better.
