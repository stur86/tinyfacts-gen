To be means that you are here right now. It is a big idea. It means you have a body and a brain that works. You are a person, and you are not like any other person.

Having a body is one part of being. Your heart beats. Your blood moves inside you. You breathe in air and you let it out. You can touch things with your fingers. You can feel if a rock is cold or if a fire is hot. You are a real thing that takes up space.

Another part of being is what happens in your head. You have a brain that thinks. You have memories of things that happened many years ago. You have dreams of things you want to do tomorrow. You can feel happy, or sad, or angry. You know that you are you. If you close your eyes and stay very quiet, you still know that you are there.

To be also means to change. You were once a tiny baby. Now you are bigger. You learn new words and you find out more about the world. You see the blue sky and the green trees. You hear music and you talk to your friends.

All of these things together make you who you are. You are living. You are here. You are part of everything that is. Being is about all the times you have from the day you began until the day you die. It is about doing things, thinking about things, and feeling things.
