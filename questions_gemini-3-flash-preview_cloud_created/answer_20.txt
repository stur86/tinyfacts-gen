"Along" is a word we use to say where things are or where they go.

One way to use it is for moving. If there is a long road under a dark sky, you can walk "along" it. This means you stay near the road and follow the line of it. You move with the road as it turns. You can also walk "along" the side of the blue water to see the sun come up.

Another way to use it is for people or animals being together. If you go to a store and you bring your dog, your dog comes "along". This means your dog is with you. You might say to a friend, "Come along!" if you want them to go with you to see a funny movie.

We also use this word to talk about how things are doing. If you are learning to play music or write, a teacher might ask, "How are you getting along?" They want to know if you are doing well or if you have any problems.

Sometimes "along" is about many things in a line. If you put several books "along" a wall, they are in a line next to the wall.

It is a good word to talk about moving, being with others, or how things are going in your life.
