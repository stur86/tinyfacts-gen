To annoy someone means to make them feel a bit angry or tired because of what you are doing. It is not like a big fight. Usually, it is just a small thing that makes a person want to walk away or tell you to stop. 

You can annoy people in many ways. You might make a loud noise when they are trying to sleep. You might ask the same question ten times. If you keep touching the hairs of someone when they do not want you to, they will get annoyed.

Even animals can feel this way. If you keep following a cat when it wants to be alone, it will make a loud noise to tell you to go away. 

Sometimes, people do not mean to annoy others. They might just be very happy or have a lot of power in their bodies. But if you see someone frown or look at you with angry eyes, you should probably stop what you are doing. This helps everyone stay calm and happy.
