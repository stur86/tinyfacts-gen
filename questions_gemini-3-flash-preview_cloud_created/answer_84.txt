To bite is to use the white parts in your mouth to press down on something. These parts are your teeth. When you bite, you open your mouth and then you close it very hard on a thing.

Most of the time, we bite because we want to eat. We use the teeth in the front to cut a piece of food. Then we use the teeth in the back to make the food very small. This helps us send the food down to our stomach.

Animals bite for many reasons. A dog might bite a ball when it is playing. But some animals bite to keep themselves safe. If an animal is afraid, it might use its teeth to fight. Some very small animals that fly might bite your skin to take a little of your blood. This can make your skin red and make you want to rub it.

Sometimes you might bite yourself without meaning to. If you bite your tongue or your cheek while you are eating, it can cause a lot of pain. It might even make a little blood come out. Little children sometimes bite when they are very angry, but this is not nice because it hurts.

You can also bite things when you are nervous. Some people bite the hard parts on the ends of their fingers. Other people might bite the end of something they use to write.
