To be fit can mean two different things. Most of the time, we think a fit person is strong and can run fast. But for animals and things that live in the world, being fit means something else. It means matching the place where you live.

Think about a white animal that lives in a place with much ice. Because it is white, it can hide on the ice. This helps it catch food and stay safe. This animal fits its home well. If you put a brown dog there, it would not fit as well. Even if the dog is very strong, it can not hide. It would have a hard time. So, the white animal is more fit for that place.

In the world of life, being fit is usually about having babies. The animal that does best is the one that has the most children. Imagine a small animal that has many babies. Then imagine a big, strong animal that has none. In this way of thinking, the small one is more fit. This is because its ways will continue through its children. These children will have more babies too.

Over a long time, the ways that help an animal match its home are seen more and more. If a new way helps an animal live and have more babies, that new way will stay. The world is always changing, so what it means to be fit changes too. What is a good way to live today might be a bad way tomorrow. To stay fit, life must keep changing to match the world around it.
