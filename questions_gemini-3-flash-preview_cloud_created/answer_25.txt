Anger is a very strong feeling. It is something all humans feel sometimes. It often happens when someone is mean to us. It can also happen when we think something is not right.

When you are angry, your body feels different. Your heart may beat very fast. Your face may turn red. You might press your teeth together. You might feel a lot of power in your arms and legs. This happens because your body is getting ready to fight or run away.

People show their anger in different ways. Some people shout or yell. Some people might even want to hit things. Other people stay very quiet and do not speak. They might have a mean look on their face.

This feeling is not always bad. It can tell us when something is wrong. It can help us try to change a bad situation. But if we are too angry for too long, it can hurt our bodies and our friends.

When you feel this way, it is good to stop and breathe. You can think of the numbers from one to ten. Talking about the way you feel can also help. It is okay to be angry, but it is important to be kind even when we feel this way.
