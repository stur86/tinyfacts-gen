To allow is to let something happen. It means you do not stop it or block it. Sometimes it is about a way that things must be. Sometimes it is about what you decide.

Imagine a child who wants to play with a ball inside the house. If the father says yes, he allows the ball to be used. If he says no, the ball must stay in a box. In this way, the father gives the child the chance to act.

To allow can also be about a feeling. You might feel very angry or sad. If you allow a feeling to stay for a while, you are noticing it and letting it be. If you try to push it away or hide it, you are not allowing it. Accepting yourself is a way of allowing who you are to show.

You can also allow someone to be near you. This means you trust them and want them in your space. To allow a person to know you is a big thing. You open your heart and let them in.

Sometimes, the world allows things that are hard. We allow time to pass even when we are sad. We allow the sun to go down so the stars can come out. When we allow, we stop fighting against what is happening and let life go on.
