To appear means that you can see a thing now. Before, it was not there or it was hidden. Now, it is in front of your eyes.

Light is very important for this. When light hits something and then comes to your eyes, that thing appears to you. In the dark, nothing appears because there is no light to show it.

Sometimes things appear from far away. They start as a tiny bit and get bigger as they come near. Sometimes things appear from around a corner or from behind a door. This makes you notice them.

There is another way to use this word. It is also about how things seem to be. A person might appear happy because they are smiling. But inside, they might feel sad. We can not always know the truth by only looking at how things appear.

Think about the sun. It appears to move across the sky every day. But we know that the ground we stand on is actually turning. What we see with our eyes might not be what is actually happening.
