An apartment is a home inside a big building. Many other families live in the same building too. You have your own front door inside the building. Behind your door, you have spaces for your life. You have a bedroom where you sleep and a kitchen where you make food. You also have a bathroom to get clean.

Some of these building places are very short. Others are very tall and go high into the sky. If you live high up, you can see far across the city from your window. To get to a high home, you can walk up the stairs. Or you might use a power box that carries you through the building to the right floor.

You share some things with the other people in your building. You might share the hallway or the area outside. Many people in cities live in these homes. This is because there is not enough space for everyone to have their own house with green ground around it.

Most people do not own their apartment. They pay money to the building owner every month to live there. If something breaks, like the water or the lights, the owner has to fix it. This makes it an easy way to live for many people.
