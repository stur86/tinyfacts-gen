This animal is a lot like a small horse. It has very long ears. Long ago, people found these animals and used them to help with work. An ass has strong legs and can carry heavy things on its back. It is good at living in hot places with not much water or food.

The animal makes a very loud sound when it wants to speak. This sound is not like a horse sound. It is very loud and can be heard from far away. Sometimes, these animals are called hard to handle. This is because when they are afraid or hurt, they will just stop. They will not move until they feel safe.

They are actually very good at thinking. They can remember ways and places for many years. Humans have lived with them and used them for a long time. They are still seen in many parts of the world today.
