To approach means to move toward something. When you approach a house, you walk until you are right in front of the door. You start far away, but each step makes you closer.

You can approach people too. If you see a friend across the street, you approach them to say hello. Sometimes you might be a little nervous to approach someone you do not know. You have to decide how you will act. Will you smile? Will you speak softly? This is your way of approaching them.

Things that are not people or places can approach. Think about the night. After the sun goes down, the dark time is approaching. Or think about a big game. If the game is tomorrow, it is approaching fast. You can feel excited as the time gets nearer.

Animals use this too. A cat will approach a small animal very slowly. It stays low to the ground. It does not want the other animal to see it coming. If the cat is too loud as it approaches, the other animal will run away.

Even a way of thinking is an approach. If you have a hard problem to fix, you can approach it in different ways. You might try to fix it quickly, or you might take your time to study it. Your approach is the way you work to find what you need.
