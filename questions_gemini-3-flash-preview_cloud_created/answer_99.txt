A book is a thing that holds many words and pictures. It is made of many pieces of paper. All these papers are held together on one side. They are covered by two hard pieces on the front and back to keep the inside safe.

A writer is a person who thinks of an idea and writes it down. They might write a story about a big animal that flies or a girl who goes on a trip. Or they might write about how the world works. They put their words onto the papers so other people can read them.

When you read a book, you use your eyes to look at the words. Your brain turns the words into pictures inside your head. You can go to far places or learn about things that happened a long time ago without leaving your chair.

Some books are very small and can fit in your pocket. Others are very large and heavy. Some books do not use paper at all. They live inside your computer or phone. You can carry a hundred books in your hand this way.

People keep many books in a house made just for books. You can go there and take a book for a while. When you are finished, you give it back so another person can read it. Books help us remember things and share our ideas with people we have never met.
