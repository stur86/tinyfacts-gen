A blonde is a person with very light hair. This hair is not black or brown. It is a color like the sun. Many children have this color hair when they are very young. As they grow up, their hair often becomes darker.

Sometimes, people with dark hair want to have blonde hair instead. They use a thing from a bottle to change the color. This can make their hair look very bright.

Most people with this hair color have light skin. They also often have blue eyes. This is because of bits inside the body that come from the mother and father. These bits decide the color of their hair, eyes, and skin.

In some areas of the world, there are many blondes. In other areas, there are not many. Many people think this hair is beautiful. Some even say that blondes have more fun!
