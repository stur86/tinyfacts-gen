Fire is something that happens when things get very hot and start to change. It is very bright and has a hot feeling. You can feel it on your skin from far away.

To make a fire, you need three things. First, you need stuff to burn. This can be wood, paper, or other things. This is like food for the fire. Without it, the fire has nothing to eat and it will stop.

Second, you need air. Every fire needs air to live, just like you do. If you cover a small fire with a glass cup, it will go out. This is because the fire uses all the air inside the cup and then it can not breathe anymore.

Third, you need it to be very hot to start. You can use a small stick that is already burning or something else that is very hot. Once the fire starts, it makes its own hot feeling and light. It keeps going as long as it has food and air.

People use fire for many things. We use it to make our food hot so we can eat it. We use it to stay warm when the air is cold. Long ago, people also used fire to keep animals that might hurt them away at night.

But you must act carefully with fire. It can move very fast, especially when the wind is moving fast. A small fire can quickly become a big one. It can burn down houses and many trees. If you want a fire to stop, you can put water on it to make it cool. You can also cover it with a lot of ground so it gets no air. Without air or without being hot, the fire dies.
