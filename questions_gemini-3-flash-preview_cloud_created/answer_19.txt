Being alone means you are the only person in a place. No other person is there to talk to you or touch you. It is just you.

You can be alone in many ways. You might be alone in your bedroom at night. You can hear your own breath. You can look at your face in the mirror. There is no noise from other people. This can be a quiet and good time. You can think and imagine new things inside your brain.

Sometimes, a thing is alone because it is far away. A star in the dark sky might look alone because it is very far from other stars. A single tree in a big field is alone because no other trees are near it.

Being alone is not the same as being sad. Some people like to be alone to rest. It helps them feel calm. But sometimes, being alone makes a person want a friend. A person might be in a crowded city with many hundreds of people, but if they do not know anyone, they still feel alone.

The things you think are only for you. No one else can see them. In that way, every person is a little bit alone inside their own head. But we all live on this one world under the same blue sky. So, even when we are alone, we are all part of the same story.
