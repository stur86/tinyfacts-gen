Age is the number of years you have been in the world. It begins when you are a very small baby. Every year on the day you arrived, your age goes up by one.

When you have a small age, you are young. You learn many things. You grow more and your body gets strong. As you get to a higher age, you stop growing up and start to change in other ways. Your hair may become grey or white. Your skin may not look the same as it did before. Some people live to be over a hundred years old.

An age can also mean a very long time in the story of the past. A long time ago, there was a cold age. The ground was covered in ice. Huge animals with long hair lived then. There was also a time when people first learned to use fire and make things from rocks. We call these long times "ages" too.

Even the ground and the rocks have an age. Some rocks have been here for a very, very long time. This helps us understand what happened in the world many years before any person was here.
