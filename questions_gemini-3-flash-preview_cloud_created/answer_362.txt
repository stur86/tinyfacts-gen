To finish something means you have reached the end. You are done with your work. If you were writing a book, you put down the last word. If you were eating food, no more food is on the table.

When you finish a job, you might feel happy. You can relax now. But sometimes, when you finish a good book or a movie, you feel a little sad. You want the story to continue, but it is complete.

There is another meaning that is not so nice. To finish a person can mean to hurt them very much. It can mean to make sure they can not fight anymore. In some movies or stories that scare us, a bad man might say he will finish someone. This means they will die or their life is over.

In a race, the finish is the line on the ground. Everyone runs toward it. The person who reaches it first is the one who did best. When you cross that line, you have finished the race. Your legs might hurt and you might have to breathe hard, but you feel good because you did not stop.

To finish a thing can also mean to make its outside look good. If you built a table from wood, you might put a clear or colored paint on it. This is called the finish. It makes the wood feel soft and look bright.

You can also finish a drink. If you have a bottle of water and you drink all of it until the bottle is empty, you have finished it. If you finish something off, it means you took the very last bit of it so that none is left for anyone else.
