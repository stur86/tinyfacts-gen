An animal is a living thing. You are an animal. Your dog is an animal. Even the tiny things with many legs are animals.

Animals are different from the green things that grow out of the ground. Trees and other green things get power from the sun to make their own food. Animals can not do this. Animals must eat other things to live. Some animals eat green things. Other animals eat different animals. They use their mouths to take in food.

Most animals can move their bodies from one place to another. They walk, run, or jump on the ground. They move in the water or fly in the sky. They move to find food or to hide from things that might hurt them.

Animals have bodies made of many, many tiny parts. They need to breathe air to stay living. They also have brains and senses. They use their eyes to see and ears to hear. This helps them know what is happening around them.

There are many kinds of animals. Some are huge and some are very small. But they all need food, air, and a way to feel the world.
