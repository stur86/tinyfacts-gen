To become means to change. You are not the same as you were before. It is like a tiny thing you put in the ground. At first, it is small and quiet. After some time, it starts to grow. It uses water and light to turn into a tall tree. The tree does not just grow up; it grows wide too. It adds a new ring of wood inside its body every year. Each ring shows a story of a year that passed. This is how the tree remembers how it grew. It is not that small thing anymore. It became something new.

People become things too. A baby is small and can not talk. But the baby grows. The baby learns how to walk and how to tell stories. Later, the baby becomes a student. Then, the student becomes a worker or a father or a mother. This does not happen in a second. It happens over many years. One day, you might realize you are a person you never imagined you could be.

You can also become something inside your mind. You might be afraid of the dark, but then you become a person who is not afraid. You can become a better friend by listening. When you listen, you learn about other people. You change from a person who only talks into a person who understands. You are always changing. The person you are today is not the person you will be tomorrow. To become is to keep moving and learning. It is how we keep living and find new ways to be.
