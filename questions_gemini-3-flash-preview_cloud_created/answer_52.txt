Attention is how your brain picks what to focus on. There are many things around us at all times. You can hear the wind, see the blue sky, and feel your shoes on your feet. But you can not think about everything at once. Your brain must decide what is important right now.

It is like using a light in a dark room. You can only see the area where the light is. If you move the light, you see different things. Sometimes, you pick what to look at. This happens when you study a book or listen to a teacher. Other times, things from the outside grab your attention. If a loud noise happens, your eyes will look toward it immediately.

If you try to pay attention to too many things, it gets very hard. For this reason, you can not write a letter and talk on the phone at the same time very well. Your brain has only a small bit of space for this work. Without attention, you would not remember anything. It helps you learn new things and it keeps you safe.
