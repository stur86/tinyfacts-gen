When you are asleep, your body is resting. You lie down and your eyes close. You do not notice the things happening around you. Your body is very still and your breathing is slow.

But inside you, your brain is still busy. It is fixing your body and making it strong again. It helps you remember what you learned during the day. It also helps your brain stay clean.

Sometimes when you are asleep, you see pictures and stories. These are dreams. You might dream about places you know or strange things that can not happen. Even though your eyes are closed, they might move quickly under your skin.

Every animal needs to rest this way. Cats and dogs sleep many hours in the day. Many other animals sleep too. If you do not sleep enough, you will feel bad. You will be tired and you might get angry easily. It will be hard to think.

When you wake up, you feel better. Your body and your brain are ready to start a new day.
