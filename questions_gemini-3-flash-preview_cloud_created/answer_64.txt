When someone is balling, it means they have a lot of money and they are not afraid to show it. This word usually comes from the game where people throw a ball into a high ring. The best player in that game can get a lot of money. They buy very fast cars and big houses with many rooms.

But you do not have to play the game to be balling. You are balling if you have a great job and buy many nice things. You might wear clothes that need a lot of money to buy. You might go to a dinner and pay for everyone at the table. It is about acting like you are the best and that you have everything you want. 

Sometimes, it just means you are doing something very well. If you are doing great at school or at work, your friend might say you are balling. It means you are the best at what you do.
