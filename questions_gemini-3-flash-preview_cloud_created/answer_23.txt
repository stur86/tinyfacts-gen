The word "always" is a word we use to say that something happens at all times. It is about time that does not end.

If you say the sun is always in the sky, you mean it is there now, it was there before, and it will be there in the days to come. Even when you can not see it at night, it is still there.

We also use this word when we talk about doing things. If you say you always clean your hands before you eat, it means every single time you sit down for food, you clean your hands first. You never forget and you never miss a time.

Sometimes we use it to talk about how you feel when that feeling will stay for a very long time. If someone says they will always be your friend, they mean they will be your friend until they are old and for all those days. It is a big promise.

It is not like the word "never." "Never" means it happens at no time. "Always" means it happens every time. If something happens sometimes, it is not always. "Always" means there are no times when it does not happen.
