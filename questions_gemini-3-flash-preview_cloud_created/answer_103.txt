Most things we see are only one thing. A car is either moving or it is still. A door is either open or it is shut. You are either in your house or you are not.

But very tiny things do not act like this. These tiny things make up everything in the world. When things are very, very small, they can be in many places at the same time. They can be doing two different things at once. This is what it means for something to be both.

Think about light. Light is what lets us see. For a long time, people questioned what light is made of. Some thought light was like a wave in the water. Other people thought light was made of many tiny balls.

Eventually they found out the truth. Light is both! It acts like a wave and it acts like tiny balls. It changes if you look at it one way or another way.

There is a story about a cat in a box. In this story, there is a tiny bit of something that might break or not. If it breaks, it lets out something bad that kills the cat. If it does not break, the cat stays living. Before you open the box to look, the tiny bit is in two states at once. It has broken and it has not broken. Because of this, the cat is both living and dead at the same time.

This only happens until someone looks inside. When you look, the thing becomes only one way. The cat becomes only living or only dead.

Our world seems easy to understand because we are big. But the tiny things that build our world are very strange. They can be here and there. They can be this and that. They are both.
