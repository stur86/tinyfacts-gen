A bar is a place where people go to have drinks and talk. It is often a room with a long counter. This counter is where the place gets its name. People sit on high chairs on one side of the counter.

A person who works there stands on the other side. This person makes drinks and gives them to the people. Many of these drinks are only for people who are old enough. If you have too many, you might feel strange or get drunk. Because of this, children are often not allowed inside.

People go to these places for many reasons. Some go after they finish work to relax. Others go to meet their friends or find someone new to talk to. Some bars are very quiet and have soft music. Others are very loud with many people dancing and yelling. You might also find games to play or a big tv to watch. It is a place to be with others and enjoy the evening.
