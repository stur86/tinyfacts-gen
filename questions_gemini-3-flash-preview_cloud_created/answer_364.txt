To fire can mean many different things.

One way is about a job. If someone does something bad or wrong, a manager might decide they should not work at that place anymore. The manager says, "You are fired." This means the person must leave and they will not get any more money from that business. This can be very hard for the person.

Another way is about a gun. When you pull a small part on a gun, it makes a tiny burst of fire inside. This makes a small, hard thing fly out of the gun very fast. It can fly very far and hit whatever the person is looking at. People use guns to stay safe or for fun games.

People also fire things they have made from the ground. They take soft stuff from the ground and form it into a cup. Then they put the cup into a very hot box. The fire in the box makes the cup hard and strong. After this, the cup can hold water and will not break easily.

Sometimes people say they are "firing up" a car. This is when they start the car so it can move. It uses tiny bursts of fire inside the car to make the parts move. We also say a person is "fired up" when they are very excited and ready to do something great.
