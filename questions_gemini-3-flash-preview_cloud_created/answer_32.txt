The word "another" is one we use very often. It has two big ways to be used. One way is when we want one more of the same thing. The other way is when we want a different thing.

Imagine being in a kitchen. You have a cup of coffee. It is very good. You finish the cup, but you still want to drink more. You might ask for another cup. This means you want one more of the same thing. If you find a book you like, you might want to read another book by the same writer. You are adding one more to what you have already.

Sometimes, we use the word to mean something that is not the same. Imagine you are putting on a jacket. You do not like how it looks. You ask for another jacket. You want a different jacket. Maybe it is bigger or has a different color. You are saying, "Not this one, but a different one."

The word "another" is actually made of two small words. It is the words "an" and "other" joined together. A long time ago, people said "an other thing." Then they began to say it as one word. "Another" is usually used with only one thing. You can have another day, but you do not say "another days." It helps us speak and write in a clear way.
