A blink is when you close and open your eyes very fast. It happens many times every minute. We often do it without even thinking about it.

Why do we blink? It keeps our eyes wet. There is a little water in our eyes that helps us see. If our eyes get dry, they hurt and grow red. When we blink, we move this water across the eyes.

Blinking also cleans the eyes. It takes away tiny bits of things that should not be there. Our eyes also blink fast when something comes toward our face. This helps to keep the eyes safe.

We blink in different ways at different times. People blink more when they are talking to a friend. But they blink much less when they are looking at a computer. This is why our eyes sometimes feel tired after we use a computer for a long time.

Small babies do not blink as much as big people do. A baby might only blink one or two times in a minute. As they grow older, they start to blink more often.
