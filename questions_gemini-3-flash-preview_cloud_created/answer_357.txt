A fine is money that a person must pay when they do something they are not allowed to do. There are things that people in a city or a school say you should not do. If you do those things anyway, you are fined.

Here is one way this happens. If you drive your car much faster than you are allowed, the police will stop you. They will give you a paper that says you must pay a fine. This fine is because you were not being safe on the road.

This can also happen with books. If you take a book from a place where books are kept for everyone, you must bring it back after some days. If you keep the book for too many weeks, you have to pay a small fine. This is because you kept the book while other people were waiting to read it.

A fine is a way to show a person that they did something wrong. It is not like buying something you want. You pay a fine because you broke an order. Groups use fines so that people will follow their orders. If people do not want to lose their money, they will try to follow what is allowed.

The money from fines can be used by the city or the school. They use it to pay for things they need to do for everyone. So, the fine helps fix the trouble that was caused by the person who did not follow the orders.
