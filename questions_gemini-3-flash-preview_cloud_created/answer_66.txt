To band something means to put a line of stuff around it. Often, this stuff can be pulled and then it snaps back to being small. This helps to hold many things together. If you have many writing things, you can put this around them. Then they will stay in one group.

People also do this to animals that fly. They put a small ring on the leg of the animal. This ring might be made of hard stuff. It has a number on it. This helps people know where the flying animal goes. When the animal flies to a far place, other people can see the ring. This way, we learn about how they live and where they sleep.

There is another way to use this word. To band together means to join other people. If there is a big problem, one person might not be able to fix it. If many people join as a team, they can do more. They are stronger when they are in a group. They work together to do something important. This is how people help their towns and their worlds.
