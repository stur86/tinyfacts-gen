A bottle is a thing that holds water or other drinks. It is often tall. It has a small top and a wider bottom. People use it to carry drinks when they leave home.

Some bottles are made of glass. If you drop a glass bottle, it can break into many tiny pieces. Other bottles are made of strong stuff that does not break easily. You can often see through the walls of a bottle to see what is inside.

To keep the water inside, a bottle has a small cover at the top. You can turn this cover to open it or to close it tight. Doing this means the water does not fall out when you move. Some bottles are for babies to use. They have a soft part at the top so the baby can drink easily.

People also use bottles for things that are not for drinking. Some bottles hold stuff for cleaning your hands. Other bottles hold things from a doctor that help you feel better when you are sick. When a bottle is empty, you can fill it again with more water or throw it away.
