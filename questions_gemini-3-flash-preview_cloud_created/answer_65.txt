A band is a group of people who come together to make music. They play songs that people like to hear. Some bands are small, with only two or three people. Others have many more.

To make music, they use different things. One person might hit a thing to make a loud sound and keep the beat. Another person might use their fingers to touch lines on a thing made of wood to make sweet sounds. One person uses their voice to speak with the music. When they all play at the same time, it makes a full sound.

The people in the group are often good friends. They must work very hard. They go to a room and play the same songs many times. They want to be sure that the music is perfect. They listen to each other to stay together.

When the music is ready, they go to a high place in front of many people. The lights are bright and the music is very loud. People in the crowd may dance or yell because they are happy.

Sometimes, a band will go from place to place. They might live in a big bus for a long time. They play in a new town every night. This is a lot of work, but it is a way to share their music with the world.
