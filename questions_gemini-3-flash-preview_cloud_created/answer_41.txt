To arm someone means giving them things to fight with. These things are often guns or things that can cut. When a person is armed, they are ready to fight or to keep themselves safe.

You can also arm a thing that will burst. Before you arm it, the thing is safe to be around. But once you arm it, it is ready to pop or break. This means it is no longer safe and could hurt someone soon.

A long time ago, people armed themselves with long pieces of wood or rocks. Later, they made things from hard grey stuff to use in fights. Now, when people say "arms," they usually mean guns and big things used by the police or the men who fight for their land.

If a building is armed, it means there is a person there to guard it. They will use their guns if someone tries to enter who should not be there.

Sometimes, you can arm yourself with facts. This means you have the right answers ready before you talk to someone. It helps you when you have a problem to fix or a point to make. But most of the time, to arm means to get ready for a fight with real guns.
