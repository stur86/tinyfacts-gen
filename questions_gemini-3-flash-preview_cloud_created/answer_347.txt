To field something often means to catch it or deal with it during a game. Imagine someone playing a game with a ball and a stick. The ball is hit high into the sky. A person runs fast to the spot where the ball will fall. When the person catches the ball or stops it from moving, they are fielding it. This is important because it helps their team get more points.

You can also field things that are not balls. If you stand in front of many people and they all ask you questions, you are fielding those questions. You listen to what they ask and you give them an answer. You handle each question as it comes to you, just like a player handles a ball.

Sometimes the word is used for groups of people too. If a leader sends a team of worker people to do a job in a far place, they are fielding that team. The team is sent out to where the work is happening so they can finish the job.
