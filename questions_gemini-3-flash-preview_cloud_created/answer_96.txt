Blue is a color that our eyes see. We see it in many places, like the high sky on a bright day. The air around the world catches the blue part of light from the sun and sends it to our eyes. This is why the sky looks blue.

A large area of water, like the deep parts of the world, also looks blue. The water takes in the red light and lets the blue light go through. When you look into deep water, you see the blue light coming back to you.

In the world of animals and things we eat, blue is hard to find. Most things that grow are green or red. Only a few small things we eat are blue. Some animals that fly look blue, but they are not actually blue like a blue shirt. If you look very close at their bodies, the color comes from how they are made to catch the light in a different way.

Sometimes, we use the word blue to say how we feel. If a person feels sad, they might say they are blue. This is because blue feels like a cold color, not a warm color like red.

Light moves in a way that is like little lines. Some lines are long and some are short. Blue light has short lines that move very fast. Our eyes have tiny parts that tell when these short lines of light hit them. Then our brain tells us, "This thing is blue."
