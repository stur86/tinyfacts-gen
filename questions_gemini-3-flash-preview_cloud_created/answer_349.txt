Fighting is when two people or many people are against each other. They might use their hands, arms, and feet to hit and push. This is the way they try to hurt the other person or to make them stop doing something. Animals also do this to keep their babies safe, or to guard the area where they live.

Sometimes, a fight is just with words. People shout and say mean things because they are angry. This happens when they do not agree on what is true or what should happen next. It can hurt your heart and make you feel sad, even if it does not hurt your body.

There are also fights that are like a game. Some men and women train for a long time to learn how to move fast and hit each other. They do this for fun or to see who is the strongest. They follow ways that are allowed by the group so that no one is killed. In these fights, people usually shake hands when they are finished.

A different kind of fighting happens inside your own brain. This is when you want to do something good, but it is very hard to do. You struggle to keep going even when you are tired or when you want to give up because you are afraid. People might say they are fighting for a better life or against a big problem.

Most of the time, fighting starts because of fear or because of not understanding each other. To stop a fight, people need to talk or listen. Sometimes, a person has to say they are sorry to make things right again. This is often the hardest part.
