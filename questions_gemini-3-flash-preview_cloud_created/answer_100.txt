To book a thing means you ask to have it for yourself at a time that has not happened yet. If you want to stay in a room in a different city, you can book it. You use a computer or a phone to tell the people who work there that you are coming. They write your name in their book. They will keep that room ready just for you. No other person can sleep there because you booked it. You can also book a table at a place where you eat dinner. You can even book a seat on a bus. This makes sure you have a place to sit when you arrive.

To book a person is a different thing. This happens when the police take someone who they think did a bad thing. They bring the person to their office. They write the name of the person in a book. They take a picture of the face of the person. They also look at the tiny lines on the fingers of the person. They do this to remember who the person is and what they did. This kind of booking is not for fun, and the person usually can not leave the building for a while.
