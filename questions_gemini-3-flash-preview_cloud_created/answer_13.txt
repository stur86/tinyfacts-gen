The word "ahead" is used to talk about space and time. It tells us about things that are in front of us.

If you are walking on a road, the things you see in front of your face are ahead. To get to them, you must keep moving forward. If you look at your feet, you see what is under you. But if you look ahead, you see where you are going. This helps you not to hit things.

In a race, the person who is the first one is ahead. They are going faster than the other people. If you are ahead in a game, you have more points or are closer to finishing than the others.

We also use this word for time. Things that will happen later are ahead. Today is here now, but tomorrow is ahead of us. If you think about what will happen next week, you are thinking ahead. Planning ahead is good and it helps you. It means you find what you need before you start something.

When people drive cars or fly in the sky, they must always look ahead. This is how they stay safe. If they see trouble ahead, they can stop or change direction.
