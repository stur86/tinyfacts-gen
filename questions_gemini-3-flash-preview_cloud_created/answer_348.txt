A fight is when people or animals act against each other because they are angry or want different things. There are two big ways to fight. One way uses the body. The other way uses words.

When people fight with their bodies, they might hit, kick, or pull hair. This can hurt a lot. It can leave marks or cause blood to come out. Often, people do this because they are very mad and want the other person to feel pain.

When people fight with words, they use their voices. They shout and say things that are not nice. This does not hurt the skin, but it can hurt the inside of a person. It makes them feel bad.

Why do these things happen? Often it is because people do not want to share. They might both want the same thing but there is only one of it. Sometimes they fight because they think the other person did something wrong. Or they just want to show they are stronger or better.

Animals fight too. A dog might fight another dog for food. An animal that flies might fight to keep its home in a tree safe. They use their teeth and feet to try to get what they want.

It is usually better not to fight. Many people try to talk instead. They tell each other how they feel. If they listen and try to understand, the anger might go away.
