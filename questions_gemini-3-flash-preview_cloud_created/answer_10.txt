To age is to get older. When you are a baby, you are small and can not walk. Then you become a child. You learn how to run and play. Then you are a young person. Soon you are a grown man or woman. In the end, you become old.

Many things change as the years go by. Your body does not feel the same. Your hair might turn white or grey. Your skin gets lines on it. The parts of your body that help you move and stay up might not be as strong as they were before. It might be harder to move fast or lift heavy things. Sometimes, your ears do not hear as well, or your eyes do not see as well.

But aging is not just about the body. It is also about what you know. As time goes on, you see many things. You learn from what you have done. You have many memories of your friends and family. You understand the world better than before. Often, older people have many good stories they can tell. They know why things happen because they have seen them many times before.

It is a part of life for every living thing. Animals and trees also get older. It is the way time moves for us all.
