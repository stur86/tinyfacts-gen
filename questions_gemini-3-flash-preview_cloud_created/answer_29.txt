Animals are living things. There are many kinds of animals in our world. Some are very big. Some are so tiny that you can not see them with your eyes.

Animals are not like the green things that grow in the ground. Green things use the light from the sun to make food. Animals can not do this. Animals must find food to eat. They eat the green things or they eat other animals.

Most animals move around. They use their legs to walk or run. Some have parts to fly in the sky. Others move through the water. They move to find food or to find a safe place.

Some animals have hard white parts inside them to help them stand. Humans are this kind of animal. Dogs and cats are too. Other animals do not have these hard parts inside. Many tiny things with many legs are like this.

All animals must have babies so more animals can live. Some mothers have babies that come out from their bodies. Others lay small round things that the babies grow inside until they are ready to come out.

Animals live in many places. You can find them in the cold places, in the hot dry lands, and in the deep blue water. Animals are a big part of the world.
