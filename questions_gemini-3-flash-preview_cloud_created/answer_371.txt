To fix something can mean a few different things.

The first way is when something is broken. Imagine you have a favorite thing to play with and it breaks. It does not work anymore. You feel sad. But then, your dad takes it. He uses his hands and some other things to make it work again. Now it is like new. He fixed it. People fix many things. They fix cars that will not move. They fix clothes with bad parts in them. They fix computers when the part you look at is dark. When you fix something, you help it become good again.

The second way is about moving. If something is fixed, it does not move. It stays in one place. Think about a picture on a wall. You put it there and it stays. It does not fall. It does not go to another room. It is fixed to the wall. This is good because we know where things are. If your bed moved around the room while you slept, you would be very surprised!

The third way is about ideas or how many things you have. Sometimes how much you pay for a thing is fixed. This means it does not change. Imagine you buy a book. You pay ten pieces of money. If you come back tomorrow, you still pay the same. The number of pieces of money you pay is fixed. It does not go up or down.

Sometimes, people say, "I am in a fix." This means they have a big problem. Maybe they forgot their money at home. Or maybe they are late for school. They need to find a way to make the situation better.

In all these ways, fixing is about making things right, keeping them still, or making sure they stay the same.
