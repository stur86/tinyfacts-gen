To bore something or someone means two different things. Both ways can feel a bit the same because they take a long time and go through things.

One way is making a deep opening in something hard. You can do this to a piece of wood or even the ground. You use a hard bit that turns round and round very fast. It cuts a long, small space through the middle. People do this to find water that is hidden deep under our feet. They also do it to put pieces of a house together. It is a way to get past something that is hard to move. 

The other way is about how a person feels. If life is not exciting, you might feel bored. If a friend talks for a long time about a thing you do not care about, the time feels very slow. Your brain feels heavy and you want to close your eyes. You want to leave and find something fun to do. This can happen when a movie is too long or a book is not new. If you do the same small job every day for a long time, you might feel this way too.
