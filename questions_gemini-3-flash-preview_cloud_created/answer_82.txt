When you say a person is great, you big them up. You say many good things about them to other people. You tell everyone that this person is your friend and that they are very good at what they do. You might say they have a great brain or that they are the best at their work.

Doing this makes the person feel strong and happy. It helps them feel like they can do anything. It is a way to show that you like them and want them to do well. It is like being the person who shouts for them while they run a race.

You can also do this for yourself. If you have a big job or a game coming up, you might tell yourself that you are ready. You say you are the best for the job. This helps you not to be afraid.

Some people big up things like movies or books. They talk about them a lot. They want everyone to know how good the movie is. They make the thing sound like the most important thing in the world. Sometimes, the thing is not as good as they say, but they want you to think it is the biggest thing ever.
