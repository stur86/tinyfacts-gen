To find is to see or get something that you were looking for. Sometimes, you lose a thing you love, like a small thing you play with or a book. You search in your room. You look under the bed and behind the chair. You feel worried. Then, you see the thing! You have found it. You feel much better.

Sometimes, you find things by chance. You are not looking, but you see something anyway. You might walk along a road and find some money on the ground. Or you might be in the woods and find a beautiful rock with many colors. This is a surprise. It makes the day feel great.

Finding is also about what happens in your head. You might have a hard question. You think about it for hours. Suddenly, the answer comes to you. You have found the way to fix the problem. You understand now.

You can find people, too. You go to a new place and meet someone. You talk and laugh. You realize you have found a good friend. This person makes you feel happy when you are with them.

To find can also mean to learn about yourself. You might try a new game and realize you are very good at it. You found something you love to do.

Finding feels like a light in a dark place. It is the end of not knowing. It is a moment when something new or lost enters your life again.
