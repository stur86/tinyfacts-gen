A bed is a thing in a house where people go to sleep. It is usually in a room called a bedroom. When you are tired after a long day, you lay your body down on this soft thing.

A bed has a hard part that stays on the floor. On top of that is a big, soft part that feels good to lie on. You put a small soft thing under your head. Then you use a cover to keep yourself warm while you close your eyes and dream. Sometimes children like to jump on the bed, but this might make their father or mother angry.

Babies sleep in tiny beds with high sides so they do not fall out. If you have a dog or a cat, they might have their own small bed on the floor. Some people share a very big bed with another person.

A bed is also a place where you stay if you are feeling sick. You can read a book or watch a movie there. Many people think their bed is the best place because it is quiet and safe.
