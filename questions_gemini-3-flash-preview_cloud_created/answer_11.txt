"Ago" is a word we use to talk about the past. It tells us how far back in time something happened from right now. When you say something happened two days ago, you mean that two days have passed since that thing happened.

Think of time like a long line. You are standing on the line at a spot called "now." If you look behind you at things that already happened, you are looking at the past. The word "ago" tells you how many steps back you have to go on that line to find one memory or thing.

One way to show this is when you say you ate breakfast three hours ago. That means you go back three hours from this moment. Or you could say that many years ago, people did not have computers. This means many years have gone by since that was true.

"Ago" is only for things that have already happened. We do not use it for things that will happen later. It is a way to see how far something is from the present moment and the things that stay in our memories.
