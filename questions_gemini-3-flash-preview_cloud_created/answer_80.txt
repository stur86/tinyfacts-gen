When we say something is big, we mean it takes up a lot of space. A house is big when you are a small child. To a tiny animal, a shoe is a large thing to climb.

A tree is big because it is taller than you. The blue water that covers the world is big because it goes on for a long way. You can't see the end of it.

The sun is very, very large. If you could put our world inside it, you would need many hundreds of worlds to fill it up. But the sun is not the biggest thing. There is even more space between the stars.

One thing is big only when you put it next to something small. We call a dog big if it is larger than other dogs. But that dog is small next to a car. A car is small next to a building.

You can also have big ideas. This means the idea is important and changes how many people think. You can have a big heart, which means you are very kind and care about others. Being big is all about how one thing looks next to another thing.
