Blood is the red stuff inside your body. It is very important to your life. You need it to be strong.

The heart in your chest moves the blood. It pushes it through many long lines. These lines go to every part of you, from your head down to your feet. It is like a group of roads with many cars carrying things.

Blood carries air to all parts of your body. It also carries food that gives you power. When parts of your body have things they don't need, the blood takes those things away to where they can be thrown out.

Blood has many tiny things in it called cells. Besides the cells, a lot of blood is made of water. This water helps everything move easily. Most of the cells are red. These red cells carry the air. There are also white cells. These white cells are like small guards. They fight bad things that make you sick and keep you safe.

If you get a cut on your skin, some blood starts to come out. But soon, it becomes thick. It blocks the cut so no more blood comes out. This helps your body fix its own self.
