To add means to put things together. If you have one ball and someone gives you another, you put the two balls together. Now you have more balls than you had before. People use numbers to show this. Computers are great at adding numbers. They can add huge numbers very, very fast.

You can add people too. When a new baby starts its life, a family adds a person. When a man and a woman get married, they add more people to their families. Often, adding a new person to your group makes everyone happy. You have a new friend to talk to or play games with.

You can also add things to make them better. You can add color to a white wall to make it look beautiful. You can add things to your food to make it smell good. If you add parts to a car, it might go faster.

When you write or talk, you might add more words. This helps people understand what you mean. Adding makes things bigger or better. It brings new parts into your world.
