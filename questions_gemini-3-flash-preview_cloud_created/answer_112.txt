The brain is a part of you inside your head. It is small, but it does everything. It is why you can think. It is why you can feel happy or sad. It stores your memories, too.

It looks like a soft, wet ball with many lines on it. It is nearly all grey and pink. Even though it is not big, it needs a lot of food and air to work.

The brain talks to the rest of your body. It sends tiny bits of power through long, little lines. These lines go to your arms, legs, and even your feet. When you want to walk, your brain sends a sign to your legs. It happens so fast that you don't even notice.

The brain also does things without you thinking. It makes your heart beat. It makes you breathe when you sleep. It keeps you warm.

Different parts of the brain do different jobs. One part helps you see. Another part helps you hear music. Another part helps you speak words. It is like a big group working together.
