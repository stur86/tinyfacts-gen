When you back someone, you help them. You are on their side. You want them to do well.

One way to back a person is with money. Imagine a man wants to start a new business. He has a great idea but his pockets are empty. You give him the money he needs. Now he can buy things and pay the people who work for him. Because of your help, his business can grow. You are the one backing him.

Another way is to stand by a friend. If someone says bad things about your friend, you speak up. You say your friend is good. You show everyone that you trust them. This makes your friend feel stronger and less alone.

You can also back an idea. If a girl has a plan to help her school, you tell her it is a good plan. You tell the teacher that the plan will work. When many people back an idea, it often happens.

To back something is like being the floor under the feet of a person. It is the help that keeps them standing when things get hard. It is very important to have people who back you in this world.
