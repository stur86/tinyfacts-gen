To better something is to make it act or look in a way that is good. It means taking what you have and changing it so it works in a better way.

You can better yourself. You can learn to do new things. You can study to help your brain know more things. If you are afraid, you can try to be strong. If you are mean, you can learn to be kind. When you work at a game, you get better. This is bettering your own life.

People better the world by fixing things. An old car might be broken and slow. A man can fix it so it drives fast again. This betters the car. People also build new computers. These new ones are often faster and smaller.

You can also better how others feel. If a person is sad, you can listen to their words. If someone wants food, you can give them something to eat. When you help a person, you better their life. This makes the world a nicer place to live.

It is important to keep making things better. If we do not try, things stay the same and never change. Making things better makes us feel glad.
