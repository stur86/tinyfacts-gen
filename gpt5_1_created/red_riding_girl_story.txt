A girl lives with her mom. The mom loves her very much. One day the mom says, "Please take this food to your sick old lady in the woods." This old lady is the mom of the girl. The girl wears a red head cover that the old lady gave her, so people call her Red Riding Girl.

The mom says, "Go straight to the old lady house. Do not talk to strange people. Do not leave the road." The girl says she understands and starts walking through the trees.

In the trees she meets a big bad dog that looks like it came from the dark woods. The bad dog is very empty in his middle but tries to sound nice. He asks where she is going. She says, "I am going to the old lady house to bring her food." The bad dog smiles and has an idea. He says, "You should pick some pretty color things that grow from the ground for the old lady. She will be very happy." The girl thinks this is a good idea and leaves the road to pick the color things.

While the girl is busy with the color things, the bad dog runs quickly to the old lady house. He knocks on the door. The old lady thinks it is her girl and tells him to come in. The bad dog jumps on the old lady and eats her in one bite. Then he puts on her night clothes and lies in her bed.

Later the girl comes to the house with the food and the color things. She sees that the door is open and thinks that is strange, but she goes in. She looks at the bed and sees the bad dog, but because he wears the old lady clothes, she thinks it is the old lady.

She says, "Old lady, what big eyes you have." The bad dog answers, "The better to see you with." She says, "Old lady, what big ears you have." The bad dog answers, "The better to hear you with." She says, "Old lady, what big teeth you have." The bad dog answers, "The better to eat you with!" Then he jumps out of the bed and eats the girl too.

The bad dog is now very full and falls asleep in the bed. A man who cuts wood for a living walks by the house. He hears loud sleep sounds and thinks something is wrong. He goes inside and sees the bad dog in the old lady bed with a huge, round middle. He understands that the bad dog has eaten the old lady and the girl.

The man takes a hard thing and carefully cuts open the bad dog middle. The old lady and the girl jump out, still living. Then they fill the bad dog middle with heavy rocks and close it. When the bad dog wakes up and tries to run away, the rocks are too heavy, and he falls down and dies.

The girl thanks the man for saving their lives. She promises never to leave the road again and never to talk to strange people. She and the old lady eat the food together and feel safe again in the little house in the trees.
