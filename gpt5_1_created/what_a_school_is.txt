A school is a place where many young people go almost every day. They go there to learn new things. A school is usually one big building, or sometimes more than one, with many rooms. These rooms are called classes. In every class, kids sit on chairs at desks. A person called a teacher stands or sits in the front of the room and helps them learn.

In school, kids learn to read words, write stories, and work with numbers. They also learn about the world: about land and water, about the sky, about animals, and about people in other places and other times. In some schools they learn by trying things, watching what happens, and writing down what they saw. In other classes they draw, paint, or play music.

School is not only for learning facts. It is also a place where people learn how to be around other people. Kids learn to wait, to listen, to ask questions, and to answer in the right time. They learn to work in groups and to share. They learn what is right and wrong in their town or city. They meet friends there. Sometimes they fight, but they also learn how to say sorry.

Most schools have sets of things you must do. When the bell rings, you must go to class. You should not hit other people. You should not talk when the teacher is talking. You must try to do your work. There is usually a person called the head of the school, who helps make and keep these things you must do.

Many schools have a place outside where kids can run and play during a break. Some have a big room where they eat lunch together. Some have a room with many books where they can sit and read. Some have rooms with computers that kids can use.

People do not stay in the same class always. When they grow older and learn enough, they move to a higher class. In many places, kids go to school for many years. At the end, they may get a paper that says they have finished school. This can help them get a job later.

So a school is a place that changes people. They go in not knowing many things. After many days and years, they know more, can do more, and can understand the world and other people better.
