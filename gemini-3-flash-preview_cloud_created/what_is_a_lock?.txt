A lock is a thing that stays closed to keep things safe. It stops people from opening a door, a box, or a bag. To open it, you usually need a key. Or you might need to use a group of numbers that only you know.

Inside the lock, there are many small parts. These parts move when you put the key in. If the key is the right one, the parts move to the right places. Then you can turn the key. When the key turns, a bar moves back. Now the door can open.

There are many kinds of locks. Some are for houses. These keep people you do not know from coming inside. Some are for cars. These make sure that only you can drive. Some locks are for the things you ride.

Today, some locks do not even need a key. You just touch them with your finger. Or you show your face to them. The lock knows you and opens.

Long ago, people made locks from wood. Then they made them from strong, cold, grey stuff. This made the locks much harder to break. Locks help us feel safe when we are sleeping at night.
