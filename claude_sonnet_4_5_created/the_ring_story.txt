There is a small round thing that can make the person who wears it disappear. But this round thing is very bad. It makes people want to keep it and never let anyone else have it. The longer someone has it, the more it changes them into something bad.

A small person who lives in a space under the ground finds the round thing. He keeps it for many years and it makes him live much longer than he should. But it also makes him sad and alone. One day he loses the round thing and another small person finds it.

The new small person does not know what the round thing can do at first. An old man who knows many things tells him that the round thing must be broken or bad things will happen to everyone. The only way to break it is to drop it into the fire where it was first made, far away.

The small person and his friends go on a long walk to get to the fire. Many bad things try to stop them. There are big animals that want to kill them. There are bad people who want to take the round thing for themselves. The small person has to be very strong to keep going.

The round thing keeps trying to make the small person want to keep it. It talks to him in his head. It makes him not trust his friends. It makes him tired and sad. But the small person keeps going because he knows he has to break the round thing.

When the small person finally gets to the fire, the round thing has made him change his mind. He does not want to drop it in. But his friend from before comes back and they fight. The friend falls into the fire with the round thing and they both burn.

After the round thing is gone, all the bad things that it made happen start to go away. The bad people lose their power. The small person and his friends can go home. They are all very tired but happy that they saved everyone.
