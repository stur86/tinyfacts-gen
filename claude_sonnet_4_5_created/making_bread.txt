To make this kind of food, you need to put together white power from growing things, water, and tiny living things that are too small to see. You also add a little bit of white sweet stuff and some other white stuff.

The tiny living things eat the sweet stuff and make lots of little air balls. These air balls get stuck in what you are making and make it grow bigger. You have to wait for this to happen. It can take an hour or more.

After it has grown big, you push on it with your hands for a while. This is called working it. It makes it soft and helps it become good food later. Then you let it grow big again.

When it has grown big the second time, you put it in a hot box. The hot box needs to be very hot. The hot box makes the tiny living things work very fast at first. They make even more air balls. Then the hot box kills the tiny living things and makes the outside hard.

After some time in the hot box, the food is ready. The outside is hard and brown. The inside is soft with lots of little spaces where the air balls were. When you break the food open, you can see all these little spaces.

The food smells very good when it comes out of the hot box. You should let it cool down before you eat it. You can eat it by alone or put other things on it. Some people like to put soft stuff from animals on their food.
