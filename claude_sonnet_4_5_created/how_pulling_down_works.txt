When you throw a ball or jump up in the air, you come back down to the ground. This happens because the world pulls everything toward it. This pulling is always happening, even when you are just standing still. We can not see this pull, but it is always there.

Everything pulls on everything else, but big things pull more than small things. The world is very big, so it pulls on us very hard. The sun pulls on the world, and the world pulls on the night light. This pull is what keeps the night light going around the world and the world going around the sun.

When you drop something, it starts to move toward the ground. The longer it falls, the faster it goes. If you drop two things where one is big and one is small at the same time, they will hit the ground at the same time. This seems strange, but it is true. The big thing and the small thing both get pulled the same way.

If you are very high up, you feel the same pull as if you are close to the ground. The pull does not really change until you are very very far away from the world. People in the sky in flying things feel the same pull we do. They do not fly around like you see in space.

When things are very far from the world, like in space, the pull is less strong. People in space seem to fly around because they are always falling around the world. They are moving so fast to the side that as they fall toward the world, the world turns away under them. So they keep falling but never hit the ground.

The pull also makes things feel heavy. If you go to the night light, things feel less heavy because the night light is smaller than the world. If you go to a bigger world, things would feel more heavy. Your body would still be the same, but the pull would be different.

If there was no pull, everything would just fly away into space. We would not be able to walk or sit down. Water would not stay in the big areas of water. The air would fly away too. The pull is what keeps everything where it should be.
