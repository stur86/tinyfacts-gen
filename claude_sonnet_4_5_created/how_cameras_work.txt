A box that catches light can save what you see so you can look at it later. When you press a part on the box, it opens for a very short time and lets light come in. The light hits the back of the box and makes a picture.

Inside the box there is a round piece of clear hard stuff. This clear piece makes the light go in a different direction so it goes to the right place. Without this piece, the picture would not look right. The clear piece can move a bit to make things look close or far away.

In old times, the light would hit a soft piece inside the box. The soft piece would change when light touched it. You had to take the soft piece out and put it in water with other stuff to make the picture appear. This took a long time.

Now, boxes that catch light do not use soft pieces anymore. They have a part that can remember light. This part turns the light into tiny pieces that a computer can understand. You can see the picture right away on a small window on the back of the box.

The part that remembers light has many many tiny spots. Each spot can tell what color the light is and how bright it is. When you put all these tiny spots together, they make a picture. More tiny spots mean the picture looks better.

After you catch a picture, you can do things to make it look different. You can make it look more bright or more dark. You can change the colors. You can make parts of the picture bigger. All these things happen inside the computer part of the box or on another computer.

Some people use these boxes to catch many pictures very fast. When you look at all the pictures one after another, it looks like things are moving. This is how people make movies.
