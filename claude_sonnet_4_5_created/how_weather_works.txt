The air around us moves and changes all the time. Sometimes it is warm and sometimes it is cold. Sometimes water falls from the sky and sometimes the sun is bright. All of these things together make what happens in the sky.

This happens because the sun makes some parts of the world warm and other parts cold. When air gets warm, it goes up. When air gets cold, it comes down. This moving air is what we call wind. Strong wind can push things around and make trees move.

Water is a big part of what happens in the sky. The sun makes water from the big areas of water turn into air. You can not see the water when it is in the air. When the air with water in it goes up and gets cold, the water comes back together and makes white things in the sky. These white things are just lots of tiny drops of water up high.

When the drops of water in the white things get too heavy, they fall down. If the air is warm, the water falls as rain. If the air is very cold, the water turns hard and white before it falls. Sometimes the hard water is bigger and round like small balls. We call these balls ice.

Some days the air has lots of water in it even when you can not see the white things in the sky. This makes everything feel wet and your skin might feel strange. We say the air is heavy when this happens. Other days the air is very dry and does not have much water at all.

What happens in the sky changes with the time of year. In the warm months, the sun is in the sky longer and makes things hot. In the cold months, the sun is not in the sky as long and things get cold. Some places have big changes between warm and cold months. Other places stay about the same all year.

People who study what happens in the sky try to tell us what it will be like in the next few days. They look at how the air is moving and where the warm and cold parts are. They also look at where the water in the air is going. But this is hard to know for sure because it can change fast.
