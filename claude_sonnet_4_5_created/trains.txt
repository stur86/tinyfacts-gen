Long cars that ride on two hard lines can carry many people or lots of things from one place to another. The hard lines are made so the cars can not go any place except where the lines go. This makes them very safe.

The first cars like this were pulled by a big thing that made fire and turned water into air that pushes. The hot air would push parts that made the big round things turn. But these were very loud and made a lot of bad air.

Now most of these long cars use power from lines above them or from the hard lines they ride on. Some still use power from burning things inside them, but most do not anymore. The ones that use power from lines are much more quiet.

The cars are joined together so they can carry more people or more things. Sometimes there are ten or twenty cars all joined together. The person at the front controls all of them at once. They can make them all go faster or slower or stop.

People like to ride in these cars because they can go very fast and you do not have to worry about controlling where you go. You can sit and read or look out the window while the car moves. Some have food you can buy and some have beds so you can sleep on long trips.

These long cars are very good for moving heavy things. One long car with many cars joined together can carry as much as many many other cars on roads. This means fewer cars need to be on roads where there are lots of other cars.

In some places, these cars go under the ground in big spaces. This is how people move around in big cities. The cars come very often and can take you any place in the city without going on roads where there are lots of other cars.
