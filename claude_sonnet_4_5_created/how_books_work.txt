A book is many pieces of soft white stuff that have words on them. All the pieces are held together on one side so you can look at them one at a time. Books let people share what they know or make up stories for others to enjoy.

Long ago, people had to write every word by hand. If someone wanted another book just like it, they had to write the whole thing again. This took a very long time. Not many people had books because they were so hard to make.

Then someone made a way to put many small pieces with words on them together to make one side of the soft white stuff. They would put black stuff on the pieces and press them onto soft white stuff. This made all the words appear at once. After they made one side, they could make hundreds more of the same side very fast.

To make a book now, someone first writes all the words. Another person reads it and helps make it better. Then the words go to a place with big things that can press the words onto many pieces of soft white stuff very fast. The pieces are put together and a hard cover goes around them.

Some books tell you true things about the world. Some books tell stories that someone made up. Some books have pictures to help you understand or just to look nice. Some books are for children and use easier words. Some books are for people who want to learn about hard things.

Now people can also read books on computers or on a small thing that only shows words. These do not use soft white stuff at all. All the words are kept inside the thing as tiny pieces that the thing remembers. You can carry hundreds of books with you in one small thing.

Many people love books because they let you learn about anything or go to any place in your mind. You can read about places far away or times long ago. You can read about people who never lived but seem real when you read about them.
