Big flying things carry people through the sky from one place to another far away place. These flying things are not like animals but they can fly because of how they are made.

The flying thing has long wide parts on each side. When it goes fast, the air moves over these wide parts in one way. The air under the wide parts pushes up more than the air on top pushes down. This makes the whole flying thing go up into the sky.

To make the flying thing go fast, there are round things on the front or under the wide parts. These round things turn very fast and push air behind them. This pushing makes it move forward.

Inside the flying thing, people sit in many lines of seats. The people can not open the windows because it flies very high where the air is hard to breathe and cold. It keeps the air inside good for people to breathe.

A person at the front makes it go where it needs to go. This person has been trained for a long time to know how to make it fly without problems. They look at things and use their hands to control it.

When it needs to come back down, the person makes it go slower. The wide parts change a bit to catch more air. It comes down slowly until it reaches the ground. Then it uses its round things to roll along the ground and stop.
