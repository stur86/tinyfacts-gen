A bicycle is a simple way to move around faster than walking. It has two big round things that turn when you push on parts with your feet. You sit on a seat between the two round things and hold onto a bar that helps you control where you go.

The front round thing can turn left and right. You make it turn by moving the bar with your hands. This is how you control which way you go. If you want to go left, you turn the bar left. If you want to go right, you turn the bar right.

Your feet push on flat parts that go around and around. These flat parts are joined to the back round thing by a metal ring. When you push with your feet, the metal ring makes the back round thing turn. The faster you push, the faster the round thing turns and the faster you go.

To stop, you pull on parts near your hands. These parts make soft things press against the round things. This pressing makes the round things slow down and stop. You need to use this before you want to stop or you will keep moving.

When you first try to use a bicycle, it is hard to keep it standing up. You have to go fast enough or you will fall over. Once you learn how to keep it up, you never forget. Your body remembers what to do even if you do not use a bicycle for many years.

Many people use bicycles to go to work or school. It is good for your body because it makes you move a lot. It also does not need any fuel like cars do. You just need to eat food to give your body the power to push the flat parts.
