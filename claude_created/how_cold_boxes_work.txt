When you want to keep food cold so it does not go bad, you use a cold box. This box keeps things inside it much colder than the air in your house. The cold makes it so that tiny living things that make food go bad can not grow very fast.

The cold box works by moving hot from inside the box to outside the box. There is a long round thing that goes around inside the box and around the back of the box. A different kind of air moves through this round thing. This different air is very good at taking hot from one place and putting it somewhere else.

Inside the box, the different air gets warm by taking hot from the food and the air inside. The round thing carries this now-warm air to the back of the box. At the back, there is a part that makes the air give up its hot to the air in your room. You can feel warm air near the back of the box because of this.

After the air gives up its hot, it goes back through the round thing to the inside of the box again. It does this over and over, always moving hot from inside to outside. A thing with moving parts keeps the air moving through the round things.

The door of the cold box has soft stuff all around it. This soft stuff stops warm air from getting in when the door is closed. If warm air got in all the time, the box would have to work too hard to stay cold. The soft stuff also keeps the cold air from getting out.

Some cold boxes have a part that is even colder than the rest. This part can make water turn to ice. It is so cold that if you put your hand there for too long, it would hurt. People use this part to keep ice for drinks or to keep food for a very long time.

You should not leave the door open for a long time. When the door is open, warm air comes in and makes the box work harder. This uses more power and can make your food less cold. Always close the door as soon as you get what you need.
