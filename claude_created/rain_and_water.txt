Water falls from the sky when it rains. This happens because of the sun and the air. The sun makes water from the ground and from big areas of water go up into the air. You can not see the water when it is in the air like this.

When the water goes up high in the sky, it gets very cold. The cold makes the water turn into tiny drops. Many many tiny drops together make the white or grey things we see in the sky. We call these things clouds.

More and more tiny drops join together inside the clouds. When the drops get too big and heavy, they fall down. This is rain. If it is very cold, the drops can turn into white cold pieces before they fall. We call these pieces snow.

The rain that falls on the ground goes into the dirt or runs down into low places. Some of it goes into small moving water paths. These paths join together to make bigger paths. The bigger paths are called rivers. Rivers carry the water back to the big areas of water.

Then the whole thing starts again. The sun makes the water go back up into the air. The water turns into clouds. The clouds drop the water as rain. The rain runs back to the big areas of water. This keeps happening over and over.

We need rain to live. Plants need water to grow. Animals need to drink water. People need water for drinking and cleaning. Without rain, nothing would grow and we would have no food. Too much rain can be bad too because it can make rivers go over their sides and cover the land with water.
