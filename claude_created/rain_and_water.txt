Water falls from the sky when it rains. This happens because of the sun and the air. The sun makes water from the ground and from big areas of water go up into the air. You can not see the water when it is in the air like this.

When the water goes up high in the sky, it gets very cold. The cold makes the water turn into tiny drops. Many many tiny drops together make the white or grey things we see in the sky. We call these things the white or grey things.

More and more tiny drops join together inside these white things. When the drops get too big and heavy, they fall down. This is rain. If it is very cold, the drops can turn into white cold pieces before they fall. We call these pieces white cold stuff.

The rain that falls on the ground goes into the ground or runs down into low places. Some of it goes into small moving water ways. These ways join together to make bigger ways. The bigger ways carry the water back to the big areas of water.

Then the whole thing starts again. The sun makes the water go back up into the air. The water turns into white things. The white things drop the water as rain. The rain runs back to the big areas of water. This keeps happening over and over.

We need rain to live. Growing things need water to grow. Animals need to drink water. People need water for drinking and cleaning. Without rain, nothing would grow and we would have no food. Too much rain can be bad too because it can make water ways go over their sides and cover the land with water.
