To make bread, you need to mix together white power from plants, water, and tiny living things that are too small to see. You also add a little bit of white sweet stuff and some salt.

The tiny living things eat the sweet stuff and make lots of little air balls. These air balls get stuck in the mix and make it grow bigger. You have to wait for this to happen. It can take an hour or more.

After the mix has grown big, you push on it with your hands for a while. This is called working the mix. It makes the mix smooth and helps it become good bread later. Then you let it grow big again.

When it has grown big the second time, you put it in a hot box. The hot box needs to be very hot. The heat makes the tiny living things work very fast at first. They make even more air balls. Then the heat kills the tiny living things and makes the outside of the bread hard.

After some time in the hot box, the bread is ready. The outside is hard and brown. The inside is soft with lots of little holes where the air balls were. When you break the bread open, you can see all these little holes.

The bread smells very good when it comes out of the hot box. You should let it cool down before you eat it. You can eat it by itself or put other things on it. Some people like to put soft yellow stuff from cows on their bread.
