Your body needs to rest every day. When you sleep, your eyes close and you stop thinking about things. Your body does important work while you sleep that it can not do when you are up and moving.

When you first close your eyes to sleep, you are still a bit up. You might hear sounds around you. After a short time, you fall into a deeper sleep. Your body gets very still and you do not move much. This is when your body starts to do its work.

While you sleep, your body is fixing things that got hurt during the day. It is also making you grow if you are still young. Your body makes new parts for your blood and your skin. All of this happens while you are not even thinking about it.

Your head does something very strange while you sleep. Sometimes you see things that are not real. These things can be good or bad or just weird. We call these dreams. No one knows for sure why we dream, but everyone does it every night. You might not remember your dreams when you wake up.

During the night, you go through different kinds of sleep. Some kinds are very deep and some are not as deep. The kind where you dream is different from the others. Your eyes move around under your closed eyes during this kind of sleep. This happens a few times each night.

If you do not sleep enough, your body and head do not work as well. You might feel angry or sad more than you should. You might not be able to remember things as well. Your body also does not have time to fix the things that need fixing. This is why you need to sleep every single night.

Most grown people need about seven or more hours of sleep each night. Young people and babies need even more than that. Old people sometimes need less. Everyone is a bit different, so you might need more or less than that.

To sleep well, you should go to bed at the same time each night. Your room should be dark and not too warm or too cold. You should not look at bright lights before you try to sleep. This helps your body know it is time to rest.
