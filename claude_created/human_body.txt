Your body is made of many parts that all work together to keep you alive. Inside you there is a red liquid that moves all around bringing food to every part of your body. Your heart pushes this red liquid through long thin roads inside you.

You need to breathe air to stay alive. When you breathe in, air goes into your body through your nose or mouth. It goes down into two soft parts inside your chest. These parts take something good from the air and put it into your red liquid. Then you breathe out the bad air.

The food you eat goes down into your stomach. Your body breaks the food into tiny pieces. The good parts of the food go into your red liquid and travel to every part of your body. The parts your body does not need come out when you go to the bathroom.

Your brain is inside your head and it controls everything. It tells your heart to push the red liquid. It tells your arms and legs to move. It lets you think and remember things. Your brain never stops working even when you are asleep.

Your skin covers your whole body and keeps the inside parts safe. Your hard white bones give your body its shape and let you stand up. Between your bones and skin there are soft parts that can pull on your bones to make you move.

When part of your body gets hurt, your body works to fix it. If you cut your skin, new skin grows to cover the cut. Your body fights tiny bad things that try to make you sick. This is why you feel better after being sick for a few days.
