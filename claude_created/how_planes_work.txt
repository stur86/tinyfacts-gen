Big metal birds carry people through the sky from one place to another far away place. These metal birds are not alive but they can fly because of how they are made.

The metal bird has long flat parts on each side. When the bird goes fast, the air moves over these flat parts in a special way. The air under the flat parts pushes up more than the air on top pushes down. This makes the whole metal bird go up into the sky.

To make the metal bird go fast, there are round things on the front or under the flat parts. These round things turn very fast and push air behind them. This pushing makes the bird move forward.

Inside the metal bird, people sit in rows of seats. The people can not open the windows because the bird flies very high where the air is thin and cold. The bird keeps the air inside good for people to breathe.

A person at the front of the metal bird makes it go where it needs to go. This person has been trained for a long time to know how to make the bird fly safely. They look at screens and use their hands to control the bird.

When the metal bird needs to come back down, the person makes it go slower. The flat parts change shape a bit to catch more air. The bird comes down slowly until it reaches the ground. Then it uses its wheels to roll along the ground and stop.
