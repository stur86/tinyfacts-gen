Music is when we make sounds that are nice to hear. People have made music for a very long time. You can make music with your voice or with things you build.

Some things you hit to make sounds. When you hit them, they move back and forward very fast. This moving makes the air move. When the moving air goes into your ear, you hear a sound. If something moves fast, the sound is high. If it moves slow, the sound is low.

Other things have long parts that you pull or push. When you pull on these long parts, they move very fast and make sounds. You can change which sound by holding the long part in different places. This makes it longer or shorter and changes how fast it moves.

You can also blow air into some things. The air inside moves and makes sound. You can change the sound by opening and closing parts on the side. This makes the air go through a longer or shorter way inside.

When many people make music together, they have to agree on what to play. One person might make the high sounds while another makes the low sounds. They have to all start and stop at the same time. They also have to play fast or slow together.

Music can make you feel different ways. Some music is fast and makes you want to move around. Some music is slow and makes you feel calm or sad. People all over the world make and listen to music because it makes them feel good.
