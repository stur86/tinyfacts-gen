Tall green things that grow from the ground give us clean air to breathe. They take bad air that we breathe out and turn it into good air. They also give animals places to live and give us wood for making things.

These tall things start as tiny things that fall from bigger ones. The tiny thing goes into the ground and water makes it start to grow. First a small green part comes up and small white parts go down into the ground. The parts that go down drink water from the ground.

The green parts at the top take light from the sun and use it to make food. They take the bad air we make and pull it into pieces. They keep some of it to make food and let out the good air that we need to breathe. This is why we need lots of these green things growing.

As the tall thing gets bigger, it makes hard stuff that holds it up. This hard stuff is very strong and does not break easily. People cut down the tall things and use this hard stuff to make houses and other things we need.

The green parts at the top change with the year. When it is warm, the green parts are making food all the time. When it gets cold, many of these tall things drop their green parts on the ground. The green parts turn red and brown before they fall. When it gets warm again, new green parts grow back.

Some tall things live for hundreds of years. They grow a new ring of hard stuff every year. You can look at the rings to see how old the tall thing is. Some are so old they were growing before anyone who is here today came into the world.

We need to keep many of these tall things growing. They clean our air and keep the ground from going away when it rains. They make homes for animals and give us nice places to walk. Without them, the world would be a much worse place to live.
