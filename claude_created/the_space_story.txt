A long time ago in a far away place in space, there was a young man who lived on a dry world. His family had a small farm. He was not happy there because he wanted to see other places and do great things.

One day, an old man came to him. The old man told him about a time when people could do great things by feeling the power around them. The old man wanted to teach the young man these ways. But bad people came and killed the young man's family. So he left with the old man.

They went to find a man who could fly them to another world. This man was not always good but he could fly his big fast thing through space very well. They also met a big animal that made funny sounds.

They learned that a woman was in trouble. Bad people had her and were going to kill her. The young man and his friends went to save her. The place where she was held was a huge round thing in space that could kill whole worlds.

They got her out but the old man had to fight a bad man so they could get away. The old man lost the fight and died. But this made the young man want to fight the bad people even more.

The young man learned to fly a small fast thing that could fight in space. There was a big fight with many people on both sides. The young man used what the old man taught him and was able to break the huge round thing. This saved many people. But the bad people were still out there and the fight was not over.
