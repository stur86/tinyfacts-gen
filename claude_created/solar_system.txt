Our world goes around a huge ball of fire in the sky. This fire ball is very hot and very bright. It gives us light during the day and makes things warm.

There are other worlds that go around the fire ball too. Some are very big and some are small like ours. The big red world is called the red world because it looks red. There is also a very big world that is so big that a hundred of our worlds could fit inside it.

Our world has a smaller round thing that goes around it. We can see it at night when the sky is dark. Sometimes it is round and bright, and sometimes we can only see a small piece of it.

All these worlds going around the fire ball are very far from each other. If you could drive a car to the fire ball, it would take many many years to get there. Even light from the fire ball takes time to reach us.

Between some of the worlds there are lots of rocks. These rocks also go around the fire ball. Sometimes a rock gets too close to our world and falls down. We call these falling rocks shooting stars even though they are not really stars.

The worlds and the fire ball and all the rocks together make up our corner of space. There are many other fire balls very very far away with their own worlds going around them.
