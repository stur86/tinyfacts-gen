People have a box that cleans shirts, pants, clothes and things for feet. You put not clean things into the box through the box doors. You add water and cleaner. A round part inside the box moves the things and the water. The moving rubs bad bits from the things. The box sends the not clean water out and brings clean water in. You set how many minutes the box will work and how the box will move. At the end the box moves very fast to send water out and make the things less wet. Some boxes also have a room to dry more. The box helps save time and hard work. Many homes, apartments and stores that clean clothes have this box.
