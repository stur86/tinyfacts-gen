A bad man who pretends to be a man of God goes around and kills women. One day he is kept in a home for bad people for taking a car that was not his. In the home he meets another man who had taken money that was not his. This man has hidden the money, but does not say where. The bad man wants to know where the money is because he wants it.

The man who took the money is killed for what he did. But the other bad man still wants the money. He thinks the man could have told his child where the money is. He goes to the house of the man and acts nice to make everyone like him. Only the child sees that he is bad. The man marries his mother and becomes his new father. He hits the child and tries to make him say where the money is. The child does not tell.

Then the bad man kills the mother of the child. The child and his sister run away. The money is hidden in the little pretend woman that the sister plays with. The bad man chases them on the long water. The child meets a nice woman who takes him in her house. Eventually the bad man finds them. He says he is the dad of the child, but the child says no, and the nice woman believes him. She chases the man away. He does not go. The nice woman hits the man with a gun and calls the men who lock up bad people. The bad man is taken to the bad people home again and killed this time. The child and his sister live with the woman who is now their new mother.
