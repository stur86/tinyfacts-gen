A girl and her dog live in a place with no color. One day, a strong wind takes the girl, her dog, and her house to a strange new land.

She wants to go home. A good woman tells her to follow a road of a bright, light color to a big green city. The leader of the city is a great man who can help her.

On her way, she meets a man made of dry stuff from a field. He wants to have a brain to think with. She meets a man made of cold, hard stuff who wants a heart to feel with. And she meets a big animal who is always afraid.

They all go together to the green city to ask the great man for help. The man says he will help them if they bring him the long stick of a bad woman.

The bad woman tries to stop them. She sends animals to attack them. But the girl and her friends are stronger. The girl throws water on the bad woman, and the woman becomes very small and then is gone.

They take the stick to the great man. They find out he is not a great man at all. He is just a normal person from their world who uses things that are not what they seem.

But he still helps her friends. He gives the field man something to show he can think. He gives the cold man a heart. He gives the big animal something to show he is not afraid.

The man tries to take the girl home in a big air bag, but it goes away without her.

Then another good woman tells the girl she had the power to go home all the time. She just needs to hit her shoes together three times.

The girl tells her friends she has to leave. She hits her shoes together and goes back home.
