A hospital is a building for people who are not well. The men and women who work there are doctors and other people who help people get better. They have many rooms with beds and other things to help.

If you are very hurt, you might go to a hospital. They can help with the hard white parts of your body if they break. You might stay for a few days or for many weeks. The people who work there watch you all day and night to make sure you are safe. Sometimes, cars with bright lights and loud sounds bring people to the hospital very fast.
