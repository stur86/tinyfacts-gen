A big water home is going across a cold water place. The water home is new and people say it can not fall or break. Many money-strong people and also many money-low people go on the water home. They want to go to a far city and start new lives.

A young woman is on the water home. She is going to marry a money-strong man, but she does not love him. She feels like she is in a box and can not get out. She is very sad and wants to jump from the back of the water home into the cold water.

A young man is also on the water home. He has little money and got his place on the water home in a card game. He likes to draw and look at the world. He sees the woman when she wants to jump and runs to help her. He talks to her and holds her so she does not fall. After this, they start to talk more and more.

The woman learns how the money-low people on the water home live. They dance, laugh, and have real fun. She feels more full of life with the young man than with her money-strong friends. The young man and woman fall in love, even though everyone says they should not.

The money-strong man and the woman mother do not like this. They want the woman to marry the money-strong man and stay in their world. They watch her and try to keep her away from the money-low young man. People fight and shout. The money-strong man becomes angry and very hard to face.

One night the water home hits a big ice rock in the water. The front of the water home breaks, and water starts to run in. The people who work there try to fix it, but the water keeps coming. Slowly the water home starts to go down.

There are not enough small water homes to take everyone off the big one. The money-strong people and women and children go first. Many money-low people can not get out because doors are closed and halls are crowded. People run, cry, and push each other, trying to live.

The young man and woman try to stay together and find a way out. The money-strong man tries to stop them and even puts the young man in a bad place so he can not leave. The woman goes back to free him. They run through cold, up-going water and crowded halls, trying to reach the top of the water home.

The water home breaks in two and the back goes up high. Many people fall into the water. The young man and woman jump into the ice-cold water. The young man finds a large piece of broken water home that can stay on top of the water. He helps the woman climb on it, but it can not hold both of them.

The young man stays in the water and holds the woman hand. He tells her to keep living and never give up. The cold water is too much, and he dies there, still holding on to her.

A small water home later comes back and finds the woman. She is almost dead, but she calls out and they hear her. They pull her into the small water home. She lives, but many others die in the cold water.

Many years later the woman is very old. She tells the story of the water home and the young man who loved her. She still remembers him and the short time they had together. Even though the big water home fell and many people died, their love stayed in her heart all her life.
