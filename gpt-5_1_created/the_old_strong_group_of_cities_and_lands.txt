Long ago, there was a very strong group of cities and lands around a wide water. At first it was only one city, with strong walls and many hard fight men. Over many years, these people fought with other groups around them. They got many big fight that went well and took more and more land, until they were the most important power in the part of the world they knew.

The people in this group loved order and written ways of doing things. They made set ways for many things: who owned what, how to deal with money, who had to fight in big fights, and what to do if someone hurt another person. These ways were very important to them, and later people in other lands used ideas from these old ways when making their own.

At first, important men met together to decide what to do. There was no single man with all the power. The important men were from a few old families. Normal people did not have the same power, so after some time they pushed back and asked for more say. Bit by bit, normal people got more power in the big talks and in the set ways.

This group of cities had very strong fight men on land and on water. Their many roads helped the fight men move fast. The roads were so well built that parts of them can still be seen today. Along these roads, people, food, money, and ideas could move quickly from one end of the lands to the other. This helped keep the far away places tied to the most important city.

They also built long water ways to bring water into dry cities. Some of these water lines were carried high in the air on tall legs of hard rock, so the water could move from the high ground down into the city using only pulling from the world under our feet. In the cities, they built large open places and high big houses for big talks, shows, and games. They liked big places with warm and cold water, where people could get clean and talk.

Their fight men took land all around the middle water, and then land far to the left side, the top side, and the right side on their pictures of the lands. They moved into a large land with water all around on the left side, and deep into lands with much white cold stuff in the top side. They reached dry lands in the bottom side and lands with high high ground and long waters in the right side. In many of these places, they set their own ways but also let people in each place keep some of their old ways.

People from different lands could move and buy things and give things more easily than before. A man could walk or ride across huge spaces while still being under the same power. Many people used the same kind of money, and in many places people used the same big way of talking, even if they still had their own home words. This made it easier to share ideas, stories, and new ways of doing things.

Their top men liked to show their power. Some called themselves top men for life. One man took so much power that some people killed him, hoping to save the old way of leading. But instead, new top men rose up, and after many fights one man became the first single head over all. After him, there were many such heads. Some were strong and good at leading. Others were bad or strange.

There were also many fights inside this great group. When one head died, often there were problems over who should follow. Sometimes men with arms picked a new head. Sometimes different men in different places called themselves head at the same time, and their groups fought each other. These inside fights made the lands less strong.

The people had many different gods at first. They made pictures and small bodies of these gods, and they burned things or killed animals for them. Later, a new way of believing that began in a small part of their lands started to move out to more people. At first, top men tried to stop it. Later heads began to accept it, and finally one head made it the big way of believing of the whole group of lands.

The great group became so large that it was hard to control. People who wanted to hurt them pushed on its long edges. In the top side, groups from cold lands crossed the lines and moved into its good growing areas. Money problems grew, and bad heads made them worse. The fight men took more and more money, and it became harder to pay them and keep the long edges safe.

Because the lands were so wide, heads cut the power into two big parts, right side and left side, each with its own most important city and head. The right side part stayed strong for a very long time after the left side part fell. In the left side, important cities were attacked and burned. Little by little, the old way ended there, and new smaller powers rose up in different places.

Even after this, the old group still left signs. Their roads, walls, and broken big houses can still be seen. Their ideas about set ways, power, and building live on in later groups. Many new ways of talking in parts of our world and other places grew from their old words. When people today think about old strong groups that were over many lands, this is often the one they remember first.
