The word "you" is a word we use when we talk to one person or more than one person. It points at the person or people we are talking to.

When I say, "You are reading this," I am not talking about me. I am talking about the person who is seeing these words with their eyes. If two or more people are reading, the word is still the same: "you." Our words do not change when there is more than one person.

We use "you" in many kinds of talk:

- When we ask a question: "Do you understand?"
- When we tell someone to do something: "Can you help me?"
- When we show feeling: "I like you" or "I am angry at you."
- When we say what we think is a good idea: "You should rest" or "You need to eat."

Sometimes we also use "you" to talk about "any person" or "people as a group," not just the one person in front of us. If I say, "When you are tired, you make more wrong moves," I really mean, "When people are tired, they make more wrong moves." Here "you" is not for one named person.

The word "you" can be the person we talk about in a line of words, like in "You are here." It can also come after other words, like "for you," "with you," or "to you." In all these, it still means the person or people we are talking to.

Long ago people used other words like this. Some people said one word for one person and another word for more than one. Today almost everyone just says "you" for all of them.

So, "you" is the word we use when we point at the person or people we are speaking to, or when we mean any person in a wide way.
