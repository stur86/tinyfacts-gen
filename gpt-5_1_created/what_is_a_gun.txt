A gun is a kind of hand thing that can hurt or kill from far away. People usually hold it in their hands. They point it at a person, an animal, or another thing, then make it fire.

Inside a gun there is a small closed space. In this space you put short hard pieces that can fly out fast. Each of these pieces sits in a small hard case with fire stuff at the back. When the gun fires, this fire stuff burns very fast and pushes the piece forward, out of the front of the gun.

Most guns have these big parts:
* A long front part where the flying piece moves. This long part keeps the piece going straight.
* A middle body that holds all the parts together.
* A place for the hand, so the person can hold and control the gun.
* A small moving piece for the finger. When you pull this finger piece, the gun fires.

Some guns can fire only one flying piece before you must put in a new one. Others can hold many pieces inside a long box that fits into the gun. This box moves new pieces into the firing place so the gun can fire again and again.

Guns are used for many reasons. Some people use them to get animals for food. Some people in the police carry guns to try to keep their homes and towns safe. Some people use guns for games where they see who can hit a far-away mark. Guns are also used in fights where they can hurt and kill many people.

Because guns can so easily hurt people, many places have strong "do" and "don't" ideas about them. In many places, you must be old enough, learn how to stay safe around guns, and sometimes show you understand this before you can buy or carry one. People are told never to point a gun at anyone if they are not in very serious trouble, and never to touch a gun if they do not know how it works.

A gun does not decide what to do on its own. It only works when a person uses it. This means the person who holds the gun must think all the time about the lives and bodies of everyone around them.
