Noise is a kind of sound. But it is not a soft, nice sound like quiet music or a small animal. It is a sound that feels too strong, or that we do not want. When people say, "There is a lot of noise," they mean, "The sounds here are too much."

Noise can come from many things. Cars and buses in a busy street make noise. People shouting or talking loud make noise. A TV or music turned up high makes noise. Big work things that turn and move make noise. Even one single person hitting a table again and again can feel like noise.

Noise is not the same for everyone. One person might like a song and say it is good music. Another person might say the same song is just noise. If you are trying to sleep, even a small sound can feel like a big noise. But if you are happy and talking with friends, you might not even notice the same sound.

Our ears and brains can get tired from too much noise. If the sounds are very loud and go on for many hours, they can even hurt our ears. People who work with loud big work things often wear things over their ears to keep out some of the noise and stay safe.

Noise can also make it hard to understand other sounds. If a lot of cars are going by, you might not hear your friend calling your name. If music is too loud, you might not hear the phone. In this way, noise is any sound that gets in the way of sounds you want to hear.

Sometimes people study noise. They try to understand how strong it is, how long it lasts, and how it moves through the air. This can help them plan streets, houses, and schools so that people inside do not have to hear too much noise.

We can also try to make less noise in our own lives. We can turn down the TV, close a door softly instead of slamming it, or decide to talk in a quiet voice when it is late at night. When everyone thinks about the noise they make, the world can feel calmer and nicer for all of us.
