Water is a clear stuff that covers most of our world. It fills big lows in the ground that we call blue places on paper. It also falls from the sky as rain and sits on top of the ground as small clears of standing water. It can even hang in the sky as white soft stuff we call sky whites.

Water can be in three big forms. When it is warm, it is a moving drink that can run and fill cups, bottles, and big blue places. When it is very cold, it becomes hard and can break into strong pieces. People use this hard form to cool drinks. When water is made very hot, it becomes a kind of clear smoke that we call warm wet air. This warm wet air can go up, move across the sky, and later fall again as rain.

Every living thing we know needs water. People, animals, and green things all need it to stay living. Our blood has a lot of water. Our insides need water so food can move and so bad stuff can leave our bodies. If a person does not drink water for some days, their body begins to hurt, their head may feel heavy, and they can even die.

Water can move and change places all the time. The sun warms the blue places and the ground, and some water goes up into the sky as warm wet air. Later, this wet air cools and turns into small clears high in the sky. When these small clears join and grow heavy, water falls down again as rain or white cold pieces. This long going-around is why we can have water again and again and do not run out easily.

Water can also change the ground. Moving water can pick up small pieces of rock and brown ground and carry them far away. Over long times, this can cut deep ways through the ground. Big blue places of moving water can hit the sides of land again and again, slowly wearing it away and changing where the land ends.

People use water in many ways every day. We drink it, use it to make food, and clean our bodies, clothes, and homes with it. We use it in bathrooms to carry away bad stuff. Big groups of people use water in places that make power by letting moving water turn big round parts that drive other parts.

Sometimes water can be a problem. Too much water in one place can cover streets and homes and make it hard for people to move or live there. Too little water can make the ground dry and brown, and green things can die. People then must bring water from far away or move to new places.

Even though water looks like nothing, it has some strange ways of acting that help life. When water becomes hard, it grows a little bigger instead of smaller. This is why hard water can sit on top of moving water. If hard water fell to the bottom, blue places in cold times could turn hard from bottom to top, and many living things inside would die. Because hard water sits on top, the top can turn hard while the water under it stays moving and can still hold life.

So water is a clear stuff that can change form, move in a long going-around from ground to sky and back, change our world, and keep all living things going.
