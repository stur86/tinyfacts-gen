Water is a clear thing that we drink. It has no color, no smell, and almost no feel in the mouth. We need it to live. Every person and every animal needs water. Without water, all life on our world would stop.

Water can be in three different forms. It can be like the water in a glass. It can be hard and cold like ice. It can also be wet air, like the white stuff you see when water is very hot and going up from a hot thing for making food. The same stuff can change between these forms when it gets cold or hot.

When water gets very cold, it turns to ice. Ice is hard and keeps how it looks. Ice takes up a little more space than the same kind of not-hard water. Because of this, ice is lighter than not-hard water, so it stays on top. This is why ice stays on the top of big bodies of water and why pieces of ice can stay on top of the water in the world. This is important, because it helps keep animals under the ice living in the cold time of year.

When water gets very hot, it starts to jump and move a lot. Then it changes to wet air. The water is still there, but now the tiny pieces that make it up move far from each other and fly around in the air. If this hot wet air cools down again, it turns back into not-hard water. You can see this when hot wet air from a hot shower hits a cold window and turns into little drops.

Water can also go into the air even when it is not very hot. When water slowly leaves a wet shirt or the ground after rain, it is turning into wet air and going into the sky. Later, when that wet air cools high in the sky, the water turns back into tiny drops. These tiny drops join together and make white and grey things in the sky.

These white and grey things in the sky are made of very small drops of water or bits of ice. When the drops in them grow big and heavy, they fall. If the air is warm, they fall as rain. If the air is cold, they can fall as soft white pieces.

Water covers most of our world. There are big bodies of water with a little white rock that makes the water taste different in them and smaller bodies of water without that white rock in them. There are also long lines of moving water that run across the land. High in high ground, water can stay as ice for a very long time.

Water can move things. Fast moving water can carry small bits of the ground and small rocks. Over many years, this can change how the land looks. Water can slowly wear down high ground and carry pieces of it far away. Water can also build up new land when it drops the small bits of ground it carries in another place.

Water is also very good at picking up other stuff and carrying it. Many things can go into water so well that you can not see them any more. This is important for life. The water inside our bodies carries food and other needed stuff to all our parts.

Water can hold hot or cold well. It takes a lot of hot feeling to make water warm, and water cools down slowly. Because of this, big bodies of water can keep hot feeling from the sun during the day and in warm months, and then slowly give it back during the night and in cold months. This helps keep the air not too hot and not too cold in many places.

People use water in many ways. We drink it and make food with it. We clean our bodies, our clothes, and our houses with it. We use falling or moving water to make power in some places. We move across water in things that can move on water. We also like to play in water, to move our bodies through it, or just to sit and look at it.

Water may seem very easy to understand, but it is important in many ways. It changes our world, it fills our bodies, and it makes life possible. When we think about water, we are really thinking about one of the most important things in our lives and in the whole world.
