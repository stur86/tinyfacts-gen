A big water car can carry people and things across water. These water cars can be larger than houses. Some are like small moving towns.

The bottom of a water car is round. This part helps it stay up on the water. Water pushes up from under it. The water car pushes down. When these pushes are the same, the water car stays up and does not fall under the water.

The water car has strong walls on all sides. Inside the walls there are many rooms. Some rooms are for sleeping. Some are for eating. Some rooms hold food, water, and other things the people need. Deep inside there are big empty spaces for heavy things like cars or boxes.

On top there is a high room where the driver works. From here the driver can see far in front of the water car. The driver turns a round part to move the front left or right. When the front moves, the whole water car slowly turns.

Behind the water car there is a turning part in the water. When the driver turns the round part, other parts move this back part. The water pushes on the back part and this makes the water car turn.

Most big water cars move with a long turning stick at the back, under the water. This stick is pushed around and around by a strong inside power maker. On the end of the stick there is a turning cross with arms. As it turns, it cuts the water and pushes it back. When the water is pushed back, the water car is pushed forward.

The power maker inside is like the one in a car, only much bigger and stronger. It burns hot stuff to make hot air. The hot air pushes parts inside. These moving parts turn the long stick and the cross on the end. Some old water cars use hot water and air from a fire instead. The hot water air pushes round parts that turn the stick.

Water cars also need power for lights, for making food hot, for talking boxes, and for other things. Small turning sticks, moved by the big power thing, turn smaller power things. These smaller power things give power. Lines carry this power to all parts of the water car.

When a water car moves, the water on the sides goes up and then falls. This makes waves. The front of the water car is small from side to side to cut the water and make smaller waves. Smaller waves mean the water car can go faster and use less hot stuff.

Water cars must be safe in bad times outside. Strong moving air and high waves push on the sides. The walls and bottom are made from strong hard stuff so they do not break. Heavy parts are kept low and near the middle. This helps the water car not fall over on its side.

On the top there are lines and small water small cars. If there is a big problem and the water car can not stay up, people can use the small water cars to get away. There are also jackets that help people stay up in the water.

To know where they are, water cars use picture papers and small sky friends. A talking box on the water car listens to these sky friends and tells the driver the place on the world. The water car also has eye boxes that send out waves and listen for them to come back. From this, the driver can tell how far away other water cars or land are, even in the dark or in thick air.

Big water cars often have many people working. Some people drive. Some take care of the power maker. Some make food. Some clean rooms and help people who are sick. All people must work together so the big water car can move in a safe way from one place to another.

When the water car reaches land, lines are thrown to people on the ground. These people tie the lines to strong sticks. The lines hold the water car still so people and things can move on and off in a safe way. Then, when it is time to leave again, the lines are taken off, the power maker starts turning the long stick, and the water car moves back out over the water.
