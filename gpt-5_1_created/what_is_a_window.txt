A window is an open space in a wall of a house, car, or other place where people are. The open space is not empty. It is filled with a clear hard thing that you can see through. This hard thing keeps out wind and rain and small animals and tiny flying things, but it still lets in light from the sun or from the street.

Most windows can open and close. When you open a window, air can come in and out. This can cool a room on a hot day or bring in new air when the room feels old and heavy. When you close a window, it helps keep the room warm and quiet.

Windows can have one big clear piece or many smaller ones, with small lines between them. These lines can be made of the same hard thing as the window, or of wood or other strong stuff that holds the clear pieces in place.

People use windows to see what is happening outside without going out. You can watch the street, the sky, the trees, or the rain from inside your warm room. In tall tall houses, windows let people look down at the city far under them.

Windows also change how a place feels. A room with big windows can feel bright, open, and happy. A room with no windows can feel small and dark. Many people like to sit by a window to read, think, or drink coffee while they look out.

Some windows have covers that you can open and close, like soft things that hang down in front of them. These help keep out too much light or stop other people from seeing in. Some windows have strong bars in front of them to make the house safer.

Even when a window looks normal, it is doing many jobs at once: letting you see out, letting in light and sometimes air, keeping out bad days of wind and rain, and helping make the place where you live or work feel nicer.
