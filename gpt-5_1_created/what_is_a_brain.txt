Your brain is the soft thing inside your head that helps you do and feel and remember everything.

Your brain takes in stories from the world. Your eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin send tiny signs through your body to your brain. Your brain reads these signs and turns them into pictures, sounds, smells, and touch. Because of this, you can see a friend face, hear a song, or feel pain when you hurt your finger.

Your brain also sends signs back out to the rest of your body. When you decide to move your hand, your brain sends a fast sign down to your arm and fingers. When you walk, jump, or talk, your brain is giving little orders all the time, even when you do not think about it.

Part of your brain keeps you living without you having to think about it. It helps your heart keep beating and your chest keep taking in air, even when you are asleep. It helps keep your body not too hot and not too cold and helps you feel ready to eat or tired so you know when to eat or sleep.

Your brain is where your memories live. When you learn something new, your brain changes in a very small way so it can hold the new memory. You remember how to walk, how to speak your usual words, and the faces of people you love because of these brain changes.

Your brain is also the place where your strong inside parts live. When you feel happy, sad, afraid, or angry, your brain is working with your body. Your heart might beat faster when you are afraid, or your face might get warm when you feel angry. That is your brain and body talking to each other.

Your brain is very busy all the time. Even when you sit still and do nothing, your brain is thinking, watching, listening, and keeping your body going. It uses a lot of your body food and water to keep working.

People brains are different from most animal brains in some important ways. Our brains are very good at using words and at thinking about the past and the time that has not come yet. Because of this, humans can make plans, build things, write books, and remember stories for many years.

Your brain can change all through your life. If you work on something again and again—like playing music, learning a game, or speaking new words—your brain gets better at it. Parts of your brain that you use a lot can grow stronger, almost like a strong arm.

You only get one brain, and it does not fix on its own easily if very hurt. Wearing a hard head cover when you ride, not using some kinds of strong drink or smoke, and getting enough sleep are some ways to keep your brain safe and working well.

So, a brain is the big place of control of your body. It is the place where your inside words, memories, and strong inside parts live, and it helps you stay living and be the person you are.
