A man takes a small round food because his sister has children who have nothing to eat. He is caught and sent to a hard work place for many years. He tries to run away again and again, so they keep him there even longer. When he is finally free, people do not want to give him work or a bed, because he has been in the hard work place.

One night a kind house of god man lets him sleep in his house and gives him food. The man who once took the small round food from the table takes bright rock-colored stuff from the house of god man and runs away. The police catch him and bring him back. But the house of god man says, "I gave him this stuff," and even gives him more. He tells him to use this new chance to become a better man.

The man with the bright rock-colored stuff changes his life. He takes a new name and starts a business. He becomes very well off and helps many very tired people. Years pass. The police man who watched him in the hard work place still wants to catch him again, because he believes the important words of the land are more important than anything. This police man keeps looking for him for many years.

In another town, a woman works in a place with many other women. Men come there at night. The woman has a little girl, but she must leave the girl with people who say they will care for her. These people are not kind. They use the girl to get money and make her do hard work. The woman becomes sick and very tired. Before she dies, the new very well off man who once took the small round food promises to find her little girl and care for her.

He finds the girl and takes her away from the bad house. He loves her like a daughter. They move from place to place and try to stay quiet so the police man will not find them. The girl grows into a beautiful young woman. She has never known any family but the man who saved her.

Later, a young man sees the girl and they fall in love. But at the same time there is a fight in the city. Young men build a wall in the street and stand there with guns to fight the men who work for the head man of the land and the police. The young man goes there too. The father of the girl wants to keep her safe and also help the young man because she loves him.

The police man comes to the wall and hides with the young men. He wants to watch them and then use the important words of the land against them. But the man who once took the small round food finds him there. He has a chance to kill the police man, but instead he lets him go free. The police man is shocked, because he always believed that people like this man were bad.

The young man is hurt in the fight. The older man carries him through water under the city to save him. The young man and the girl later get married. The older man is glad, but he is also tired and sick from so many years of running and hiding.

The police man can not accept that the man he followed for so long has become good. His ideas about the world are broken, and he does not know how to live with this new truth. In the end he kills himself.

The older man tells the young couple the story of his life. He says he took care of the girl because of the promise he made to her mother. Then he dies quietly, knowing that the girl he saved now has love, a home, and a better life than he ever had.
