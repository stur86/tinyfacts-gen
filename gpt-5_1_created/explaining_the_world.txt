The world is the big place where all of us live. When you walk outside and see the ground, the sky, the trees, the water, and every person and animal, you are seeing small parts of the world. The world is not only the land under your feet. It is also the water, the air, and all the living things that use that land, water, and air.

The world is round like a ball. If you could walk in a straight line for a very long time and never stop, in the end you would come back to the place where you started. People did not always know this. Long ago, some people thought the world might stop at the far edge of the big water. Now we have gone all around the world in big flying and moving things many times, so we know its form.

The world is covered in many kinds of places. Some places are cold, with ice much of the year. Some places are hot, with little rain and a lot of tiny rocks. Some places are in the middle, with warm summers and cold times in the rest of the year. There are high tall places, low fields, deep cuts in the ground, and wide long waters. All these very different places are parts of the same world.

Most of the world is covered with water. If you look at a picture of the world, you can see that the blue parts are much bigger than the brown and green parts. The blue parts are the great waters where many big moving things carry people and food. The brown and green parts are the big pieces of land where we live. The water and land together make the outside of the world.

The world also has an inside. Under the ground, there is more rock. Very deep down, the rock is so hot that it is soft and can move slowly. Sometimes this hot rock pushes up and breaks through the ground. Then we see fire come out of the top of a high place. When the fire comes out, it can change the land around it.

The world does not sit still in space. It goes around the sun, and it also turns around and around. Because of this turning, we have day and night. When the part of the world you stand on faces the sun, you see light and call it day. When your part of the world turns away from the sun, it is dark and you call it night. Because of the world going around the sun, we have warm and cold parts of the year.

The world is also the home of all living things we know. There are people in cities and towns. There are trees in great green areas of deep woods. There are animals running on the land, moving in the water, and flying in the air. Tiny living things too small to see live on your skin, in the ground, and in the water. All of these together make life on the world.

People like to break the world into many smaller parts. We draw lines on pictures of the world to show these parts. On one side of a line there may be one group of people with their own words and ways. On the other side there is another group with different words and ways. Even when people fight over these lines, the land and water under them are still part of one world.

When people say "the world," they sometimes do not mean the ground and water at all. They may mean all the people living on the world. We might say, "The world is watching," when many people are paying attention to some big story. In this way, "the world" can mean the minds, hopes, and worries of people in every place.

The world feels very big. It would take many lives to see every city, walk in every deep wood, and move in every great water. But the world can also feel small. When one place has a big problem, like a heavy time of strong rain or a long time with no rain, people in far away places can still feel it. They might send money, food, or other help. The things we do in one part of the world can change what happens in other parts.

No one owns the whole world, but all of us together share it. The air you breathe today will move and become the air someone else breathes tomorrow. The water you drink will one day fall again as rain in some other place. Because we all share the same world, many people think we should take care of it, so that it can stay a good home for us and for all living things.

So, the world is the round ball of land, water, and air that goes around the sun. It is the place where day and night, warm and cold times, and every kind of sky change happen. It is also all the growing things, animals, and people living on that ball. And in another way, the world is all of us together, trying to live, work, and dream on the same small, bright place in space.
