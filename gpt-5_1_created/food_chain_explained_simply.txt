All animals and green things that grow from the ground need food to live. A food line explains how this food moves from one living thing to another.

First, there are green things that grow from the ground. They are the start of almost every food line. They take light from the sun. They also take water from the ground and air from around them. They use these things to make their own food inside their leaves and other parts. Because they can make food from light, they are very important.

Next, there are animals that eat green things. A small jumping animal eats short green ground cover. A bigger four leg animal eats leaves. A tiny moving animal eats parts of green things. These animals take the food that was inside the green things and use it to grow, move, and stay warm.

Then, there are animals that eat other animals. A dog eats the small jumping animal. A big water animal eats a small water animal. A flying animal eats a tiny moving animal. When they eat these animals, they also take in the green food that was inside them before. In this way, green food moves from green things, to green eating animals, to animals that eat other animals.

At the end of the food line, there are tiny living things in the ground. They eat dead green things and dead animals. They turn bodies, leaves, and other dead parts into very small bits in the ground. These bits become part of the ground again. Then up‑taking parts of green things can take them in and use them to grow new leaves and other parts.

So the food line goes around again and again. Food moves from the sun, to green things, to animals that eat green things, to animals that eat other animals, and then back into the ground, where green things can use it again. When one kind of green thing or animal is gone, it can break the food line and make life hard for many other living things.

There are many food lines in the world. In big water, tiny green things are in the water and take light from the sun. Tiny animals eat them. Small water animals eat the tiny animals. Bigger water animals eat the small ones. A person might catch and eat the big water animal. On land, short green ground cover might be eaten by a tiny ground animal. A flying animal eats the tiny ground animal. A house cat eats the flying animal. Each step is part of the food line.

Every person is also part of many food lines. When we eat white long pieces, we eat food from green things in a field. When we eat animals, we eat an animal that ate green things or other animals. Because of this, when we hurt the places where green things and animals live, we also hurt our own food lines.

If we take care of green things, animals, and the places where they live, we help keep food lines strong. This helps all living things, us too.
