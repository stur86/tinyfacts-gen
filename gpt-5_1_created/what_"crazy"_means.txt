People use the word "crazy" in many ways, and that can cause a lot of trouble.

Sometimes people say "crazy" when they really mean, "That thing is very different from what I know," or "That thing scares me," or "That person does not act like I do." In that case, the word tells us more about the person who is talking than about the person they talk about.

People also say, "That was a crazy night," or, "This game is crazy." Here the word can mean, "very strong," or "hard to believe." It might even mean, "fun in a big way." When friends talk this way and no one gets hurt, the word is not as much of a problem, but it is still not very clear.

Sometimes people use "crazy" to talk about someone who has a hard time with what goes on in their head or how they feel. A person might hear words that are not really there, or feel very sad for a long time, or feel big fear for no clear reason. These are real body problems in the head, just like there are real body problems in the arm or leg. Using the word "crazy" for these things can be not nice.

When we say, "He is crazy" or "She is crazy," we put a heavy mark on that person. Other people might start to see them only as that word and not as a full person with a life, hopes, and good parts too. This mark can make it harder for the person to get help, to keep friends, or to feel okay about themselves.

Because of this, many people try not to use the word "crazy," or they use it only for things, like "a crazy idea" or "a crazy game," and not for people. Some try to say more clear things, like, "That is hard to understand," "That scares me," or, "That person needs help with how they feel." These words are longer, but they are also kinder and clearer.

So, what does "crazy" mean? It does not have just one meaning. Often it means, "very, in a way I do not expect." It can mean fun, strange, or bad, and the meaning changes with how and where people say it. Because the meaning changes so much, and because it can hurt people, it is usually better to slow down and pick other words that say exactly what we mean.
