Animals are living things that can move by themselves and feel the world around them. People are animals, and so are dogs, cats, and many others. Your own body is an animal body.

Most animals need to breathe air, eat food, and drink water to stay living. They grow from babies to grown people or grown animal bodies. They can usually have babies of their own so more animals of that kind can live after them. When animals get hurt, their bodies try to fix the hurt places. When they get sick, their bodies fight to get better.

Animals can sense what is happening around them. Many animals see with eyes, hear with ears, and smell with noses. They can feel when something touches their skin. Some can tell different kinds of food in their mouths. These senses help animals find food, find friends, and stay away from things that might hurt them.

Animals move in many different ways. Some walk or run on the ground. Some fly through the sky. Some move through water. Some do more than one of these. Moving lets animals escape from things that might hurt them and lets them go to new places to find food or a better home.

Animals also have mouths to take in food, and most have a place inside where food is broken down into smaller parts the body can use. The body then sends the good parts of the food to every part inside, like the heart and brain, so the animal can move, grow, and think.

Many animals live together with others of their kind. A group of animals can help watch for things that might hurt them and help find food. Some animals take care of their babies for a long time, showing them how to live, what to eat, and what to fear.

There are many different kinds of animals in the world. Some are very small, and some are very big. Some live in water, some on land, some in the air, and some move between these. But all animals are living bodies that can sense the world, move, and use food to stay living.
