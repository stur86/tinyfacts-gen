Fire is when stuff burns and gives off light and strong warm. It can be small, like a little bright part on a stick, or very big, like when a whole building or a woods place is burning.

Fire needs three things to start and stay. It needs something that can burn, like wood or paper or other stuff from under the ground. It needs air. It also needs enough warm. If one of these three things is missing, the fire will go out.

When fire burns, the burning stuff changes. Wood turns into smoke and strong warm. The grey soft stuff stays on the ground. The burning part that we see is the bright moving part. The bright part can be red, blue, or other colors, changing with what is burning and how strong the burning is.

Fire is very strong and very hot. It can hurt skin and eyes. It can kill people and animals. It can burn houses, cars, and whole towns. This is why people build teams and big cars to fight big fires and keep people safe.

But fire can also be good. People use fire to make food safe to eat and make it better. Fire keeps people warm in cold places. For a long time, people used fire in small light things to see at night. Many businesses and homes still burn stuff from under the ground or other things to make warm.

Fire has been important for people for a very long time. Early humans learned to keep and move fire from place to place. Later, people learned how to start fire by themselves, first by rubbing things together, later by using small hard things that make a tiny bright when they hit. Once people could use fire any time, they could make more kinds of food, live in colder places, and build new kinds of work places and homes.

There are also fires that happen without people. During hot, dry summers, woods can catch fire. Bright sky lines can hit trees and start big fires that move fast and burn a lot of land. These fires can kill many animals and break homes. But they can also clear old green stuff away, and after some time, new green stuff grows back.

Because fire is so strong, people made ways in their heads about how to use it. We keep match sticks away from kids. We do not leave small light things and hot boxes burning when no one is watching. In many homes there are things on the walls that can smell smoke and make a loud sound to warn people so they can get out.

So fire is both a bad thing and a helper. It changes stuff by burning it, and gives us light and warm. Without fire, people would live very different lives. But because fire can hurt and kill, we must always be slow and thinking when we use it.
