A computer is a box that can help us think and work faster.

Inside the box there are many tiny parts. Some parts hold numbers and words like a very fast book. Other parts do hard thinking work. There are also ways that let little bits of power move around inside the box, like streets in a city. When the power bits move in some ways, they mean "yes." When they move in other ways, they mean "no." The computer uses many, many tiny yes and no moves to do its work.

The computer can not understand talking the way people do. It only understands very easy number signs. We give it orders by turning our words into these number signs. A person writes a group of steps that tells the computer what to do, step after step. The computer can follow these steps very quickly without getting tired or bored.

Most people do not touch the small inside parts. They touch the outside parts. A tv shows pictures and words. A keys thing lets you push little keys to send letters and numbers into the box. A hand thing lets you point at things on the tv. These outside parts are also part of the computer family.

Computers can remember things for a long time. They can keep letters, stories, pictures, and music. They can help us write, talk with friends far away, play games, watch movies, and do money work. They can also help in schools, hospitals, roads, and many other places. In some homes there are small computers in the phone, in the tv, in the car, and even in the clothes cleaner.

A computer does only what we tell it to do. If it seems to act in a strange way, it is usually because a person gave it bad steps or pushed the wrong thing. The computer does not feel, want, or care like a person. But because it can do easy things very fast and can remember so much, it has become one of the most important things in our world today.
