A boy lived in a small town near a dark wood. The boy loved stories about big, fear-making animals that walked like people, and about dead people who still walked at night, but his mom and dad said, "Those are only stories. There is nothing out there but trees, animals, and the wind."

Still, every night, when the wind moved through the trees, the boy thought he heard a voice. Sometimes it sounded like his name. Sometimes it sounded like a low song. When he told his friends, they laughed and said, "You just like to scare yourself."

One summer the days were very hot, but the nights were cool. The boy started to open his window at night to feel the cool air. The sound from the wood became clearer. He could hear words now, but not all of them. He heard, "Come..." and "help" and something that sounded like "hurt."

The boy felt afraid but also interested. He could not stop thinking about the voice. One night, when the white round light in the sky was high and big, he decided to go to the wood and find out what the voice was.

He put on his shoes, moved slowly down the hall so he would not wake his parents, and stepped outside. The night was very quiet. The town lights were behind him; in front of him the wood was a big black wall.

"This is stupid," he whispered to himself. But he kept walking. When he reached the first trees, the voice came again.

"Come... please... it hurts."

The boy had a tight feeling in his stomach. His feet wanted to run back home, but something in his heart pushed him forward. He walked between the trees. The air felt colder there, and the sounds of the town were gone. Only the wind and the voice were left.

The voice grew clearer as he walked. "Not far now," it said. "You are almost here."

"Who are you?" the boy asked.

"A friend," the voice said. "Someone who has waited a long, long time."

The boy followed the sound along a long brown way on the ground. Tree arms grabbed at his jacket and hair. Once he tripped and fell, and his hands landed in cold, wet ground. He wanted to cry, but he did not. He got up and kept going.

At last he came to a small open place in the wood. In the middle stood a tree that was larger than all the others. Its middle was thick and turned in strange ways, and its long tree arms went out like long arms.

The voice came again, but this time it did not sound like it was far away. It sounded like it was all around him.

"You came," it said. "Thank you."

"Where are you?" the boy asked.

"Here," said the voice. "Right here."

The boy looked at the big tree. Its skin was dark and not even, and there were old marks on it that almost looked like words. When he put his hand on the middle of the tree, the wood felt warm, like skin.

"Are you... the tree?" he whispered.

"Yes," said the voice, soft but very clear now. "I am this tree. I am also the wood, and the wind that moves through it. Long ago, people in your town used to come here. They sat under my arms and told stories. They laughed, they cried, they played. They brought their fears and their hopes and left them with me."

The boy stared up at the arms, which moved a little even though there was almost no wind.

"But then they stopped coming," the tree went on. "They built more houses, more streets. They watched more tv. They forgot the wood. They forgot their stories. They forgot me."

The boy felt something like heavy sad in the air around him.

"Why did you call me?" he asked.

"Because you still listen," the tree said. "Every night you heard me. You did not laugh at the sound inside the wind. You did not say, "It is nothing." You believed there might be more. And there is."

"What do you want me to do?" the boy asked.

"Tell a story," said the tree. "Tell me a story that is your own. Give me something new to hold. I am full of old stories, but I am empty of new ones. That is the hurt you heard."

The boy felt his face grow hot. "I don't have a good story," he said. "I am just a kid from a small town. Nothing big has ever happened to me."

"You walked alone into a dark wood because you heard a voice no one else believed in," the tree said. "That seems like a story to me. Start there."

The boy sat down at the foot of the tree. He took a deep breath. His hands were still a little wet and brown, and there was a small cut on his knee from the fall. The sky above the arms was full of stars.

So he started to talk.

He told the tree about his town, about his street and school and friends. He told it about the way his dad laughed too loud at his own jokes, and the way his mom made a soft sound like a song while she made dinner. He told it about the time his best friend moved away and he cried in his room at night so no one would hear.

The tree listened. The leaves made a soft sound, like someone saying "yes" over and over.

The boy went on. He talked about his fears: that he would never do anything important, that he would always be small and quiet, that no one would ever really know who he was inside. He talked about the voice, and about this night, and about how afraid he had been to come, and how he had come anyway.

"This is your story," the tree said gently. "And you are still in the middle of it. You do not know the end yet."

"What if the end is bad?" the boy asked.

"Many stories are sad in parts," the tree said. "But the sad parts are not the whole story. Even when people die, even when houses fall and worlds change, the stories stay. They move into other hearts. They change, but they do not end."

The boy was quiet for a while. He could feel the warm tree against his back. He could hear his own heart beating, and under that, something like another heart, slow and deep inside the wood.

"Can I come back and tell you more stories?" he asked.

"Please," the tree said. "Bring others, too, if they will come. I have waited a long time. I can wait more. But it is nicer when I do not have to wait alone."

The boy stood up. For the first time since he had stepped into the wood, he did not feel afraid. The dark trees around him did not look like a wall anymore. They looked like a crowd of tall, quiet friends.

"Thank you," he said to the tree.

"Thank you," the tree answered. "You brought me a new story. Now you carry mine with you. When you tell it, I will be there, too."

The boy walked back toward the town. The way did not seem as long now. When he looked back once, he saw the big tree standing still and strong in the middle of the open place. For a moment he thought he saw a soft light around it, like a very quiet smile.

Years later, when the boy was a man, people sometimes asked him why he told so many stories. He would smile and say, "Because someone important once asked me to." If they laughed or said, "Who?" he would just shrug and start another story.

Often, the story he told was this one: about a small town, a dark wood, a quiet tree, and a boy who thought he was not important enough to have a story of his own, until the night he found out he was wrong.
