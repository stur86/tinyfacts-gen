Air is the stuff all around us that we breathe in and out. We can not see it, but it is there all the time, filling rooms, streets, houses, and the spaces between trees and other things. When wind moves, it is really air moving past us.

Air is not just one kind of thing. It is many tiny pieces together in one place. These pieces are so small we can not see them, even if we look very hard. They move around very fast and hit each other. They also hit us and everything else. That pushing is what we call air push.

There is air high above us, too. It makes a big soft cover around our world. This air cover helps keep us safe. It keeps the ground from getting too hot in the day and too cold at night. It also helps keep water and white sky stuff near our world instead of letting them fly away into the dark sky.

We need air to live. When we breathe in, our chest grows bigger and pulls air inside. Our body takes from the air what it needs. Then we breathe out the used air. Our blood carries the good part from the air to all parts of our body so our arms, legs, and brain can work.

Green parts of trees and other growing things need air too. During the day, these green parts take in one part of the air and give back another part that helps us breathe. In this way, people and green growing things help each other by changing the air back and back again.

Air can also carry other tiny pieces, like smoke or water. When there are too many bad pieces in the air, breathing can hurt or make us sick. Smoke from cars, houses, and fires can make the air bad to breathe. This bad air can bother our eyes, throat, and chest and can also hurt green growing things and animals.

High up, the air is not as thick. That means there are fewer tiny pieces in the same space. It is harder to breathe on very tall high land because there is less air push and fewer good parts of the air in each breath. This is why people may feel tired or get a head pain when they go up very high.

When air gets warm, it grows and becomes lighter. Warm air goes up. Cooler air moves in to take its place. This up and down moving of warm and cool air helps make winds, white sky stuff, falling water from the sky, and big strong sky hits. So air is a big part of what we call sky changes.

Even though we can not see air, we can feel it and see what it does. We feel it when wind pushes our hair or clothes. We see it when it makes leaves move or long sky things on a tall stick wave, or when it makes white sky stuff race across the sky. Without air, there would be no sounds, no fires, and no life like we know it. Air may seem like nothing, but it is one of the most important things around us.
