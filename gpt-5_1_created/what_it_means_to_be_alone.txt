To be alone can mean many things.

Sometimes it just means there is no one else in the room. You sit on your bed, or walk down a street, and no one is with you. You can hear your own breath. You can listen to small ideas in the air that you do not notice when people talk around you. Your body is in a quiet space, and you have time to think.

Being alone can feel safe and warm. No one is watching you, so you can laugh or cry or sit in a strange way and it is alright. You can read, or draw, or just lie on the floor and look at the wall. Time can move more slowly. You can listen to your own mind and learn what you really want, without other people telling you what they think you should do.

But being alone can also feel cold and heavy. You might feel that no one sees you, or that no one would notice if you were gone. You start to wonder if you matter. In these times, the quiet does not feel warm. It feels like a big empty room inside your chest. You might wish for someone to knock on your door or call your name.

To be alone is not always the same as having no people around you. You can stand in a bus full of people or sit in a loud room at school and still feel alone. You might feel that no one understands you, or that you must hide your real ideas and your heart. You talk and laugh with others, but inside you feel like you are standing far away, watching yourself from another place.

Sometimes people pick to be alone. They close the door, turn off their phone, and stay by themselves on plan. They do this to rest from the busy world, or to work, or to think about a big question in their life. This kind of alone can help you grow. You start to know your own mind better. You see which ideas are only for you.

Sometimes people do not pick to be alone. Friends move away. Family people fight. Someone important dies. Or you move to a new place where no one knows your name. Then alone can feel like a long dark hall with many doors that do not open. In these moments, a small kind act—a short "hello," a smile, a hand on your shoulder—can feel huge, like a light at the end of the hall.

To be alone can also mean to be different. Maybe your ideas, your clothes, the music you like, or the way you love are not the same as most people around you. They may not say anything bad, but you still feel like you are standing on another side of a wide road. You can see them, but you do not feel you can cross over and join them.

Everyone feels alone sometimes, even people who look very happy and have many friends. Feeling alone is part of being human. It is your mind saying, "I want to be seen and known." This feeling can hurt, but it can also push you to reach out—to send a short note, to say "can we talk?", to listen when someone else is hurting too.

In the end, to be alone means to stand with yourself, without anyone else between you and your own mind. Sometimes this is a soft, good quiet. Sometimes it is a deep, strong hurt. Learning to live with both kinds—to enjoy the quiet times and to ask for help when the dark times come—is a big part of growing up and of knowing your own heart.
