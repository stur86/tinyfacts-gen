An office is a place where people go to do work. Many people go there almost every day, in the morning, and leave in the evening. Some people wear nice clothes when they go to the office.

An office can be in a big building in a city, or in a small building in a town. Sometimes one business has many work places in different cities and parts of the world. Some offices are in tall work towers with many floors. Other offices are in houses that were changed to be work places.

Inside an office there are rooms with desks, chairs, and computers. People sit at the desks and use their hands to type on keys. They write notes and work with different kinds of facts. There are also phones, so people can talk to other people at the office or to people who are not in the same place.

In many offices there is a head person or manager. The head person gives other people jobs to do and checks that the work is done well and on time. In some offices this person sits alone in a smaller room with a door. In other offices this person sits with everyone else.

Some offices are quiet places where people speak softly so others can think. Other offices are louder, with people talking in groups, phones ringing, and people walking in the hall. Many offices have a meeting room where people sit around a table to talk, share ideas, and make plans. There might be a white wall where they write important points.

Most offices also have a break room or kitchen area. In this place people can make coffee, eat lunch, and talk. There might be a cold box, a table, and a few chairs. Taking a short break can help people feel less tired and work better when they go back to their desks.

Offices can feel very different from each other. Some offices are bright, with big windows and lots of light. Some are dark, with only a few small windows. Some have pictures to make the place feel more warm. Some are very plain, with only desks and computers.

Today, some people do not go to an office at all. They work from home or from other places, using computers to stay in touch with their office and other people they work with. But even when people are far away, they still say they "work in an office" if they are part of this kind of work group.

In short, an office is a work place where people come together to share facts, make plans, and help a business do its jobs.
