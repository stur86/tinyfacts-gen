People use the word "real" all the time, but it is hard to say what it means in a clear way.

One way to talk about "real" is to say: A thing is real if it is there even when no one is looking at it or thinking about it. A tree in a field is real. If you walk away and no one is there, the tree does not disappear. It is still there. The same is true for the sun, the ground, your body, and other people.

But this first idea has some problems. Think of the things you feel inside you, like fear, love, or pain. You can not see them like you see a tree. Still, when you feel pain, it really hurts. If your friend says, "Your pain is not real," you would be angry. So we also say these inside things are real, even though they are inside us and do not stand outside our bodies like a tree.

Another way to talk about "real" is: A thing is real if it can change what happens. If something can change what happens, we call it real. Your body is real because it can move, break, and get better again. Your inside fears and loves are real because they can make you cry, laugh, or change what you do. A story can be real in this way, too: a story that makes you change your mind has done something real to you, even if the story talks about things that never happened.

We also talk about "real" when we want to say that something is not made to lie to us. A real money piece is not paper that someone drew numbers on at home. When we say, "Is this real or not?" we are asking if the thing is what it seems to be. If it really came from the place or in the way people say it did, then we say it is real.

People also use "real" when they talk about dreams, games, and pictures. When you dream at night, the dream feels real while it is happening. You may wake up with your heart beating fast. But when you open your eyes and look around, you say, "Oh, it was only a dream." By this you mean: It felt strong and true, but it was not part of the shared world that other people live in with you.

In games, there is a "game world" and the "real world." Inside the game, you can "die" and then stand up again when the game starts over. In the shared world outside the game, death does not work that way. So we say the game world is not real in the same sense. But the time you spend, the fun you have, and the things you learn are still real, because they change you.

Pictures and shows on a tv give us another kind of question. The people in a movie might not be real people doing those things. They are people who pretend. But the light in front of you is real. The sound is real. The strong inside life in the people who watch is real. The movie can lead to real tears, real laughs, and real ideas.

We sometimes say things like, "Be real," or "Get real." Here, "real" means that we want someone to stop pretending. We use it to ask someone to stop acting like something is true when it is not. When someone finally accepts a hard truth about their life, we might say, "Now they are being real with themselves."

The word "real" is also used when we talk about numbers and ideas. These things do not sit on a table, and you can not hold them in your hand. But we still speak of them as real in another way. The number two is not a thing you can touch, but without numbers we could not say how many things we have, build houses, or send people very far up into the sky. So we say numbers are real inside our minds, because they help us understand and control the world.

Maybe the best way to think about "real" is to see that it has more than one use:

1. Real as "out there": things like trees, rocks, and stars that are there whether or not you look.
2. Real as "felt inside": things like fear, love, and hope that live in our bodies and in what we think but still matter.
3. Real as "not made to lie to us": the way we talk about real money, real names, or real stories when we want to know if something is true.
4. Real as "changes what happens": anything that can change what happens to us or how we live.

When someone asks, "Is it real?" the best answer is often, "Real in which way?" A picture of a tree is not a real tree, but it is a real picture. A dream is not part of the shared outside world, but it is a real dream that can change how you feel the next day.

So "real" is not just one small and easy thing. It is a word we use to show that something really happens, really matters, or really is what it seems. To understand what "real" means, you always have to look at how people are using the word in that moment and what they are trying to tell you about the world, about themselves, or about you.
